## Screenshot Capture Guidelines

When capturing screenshots:

1. **Use consistent browser width** (1200px recommended)

3. **Use sample project** "Demo Project - Smith Residence" or similar
4. **Annotate with:**
   - Red boxes for highlights (3px border)
   - Red arrows for callouts
   - Labels in red text with white background
5. **Save as PNG** for UI screenshots
6. **File naming:** Use lowercase, hyphens, numbered prefixes within folders
