## Still Needed - Manual Screenshot Captures

### High Priority (mentioned in multiple places)
1. **Stage detail page with task completion metrics** - needed for:
   - tasks/checking-job-status.md
   - Multiple stage-related docs

2. **Task creation form - optional/advanced fields** - needed for:
   - tasks/creating-tasks.md (Line 82)

3. **Pre-Construction stage showing submittal tasks** - needed for:
   - submittals-rfis-change-orders/submittals.md

4. **Pre-Construction stage showing RFI task** - needed for:
   - submittals-rfis-change-orders/rfis.md

### Medium Priority
5. **Contact detail showing "Linked Projects" field** - needed for:
   - contacts/linking-to-projects.md
   - Note: Existing screenshots show Customer/GC from project side, not the reverse

6. **Task detail showing attachments section with files** - needed for:
   - submittals-rfis-change-orders/change-orders.md

## Notes

### Reuse Strategy
- Successfully repurposed project form screenshots for task documentation
- Many existing images work across multiple contexts

### Missing Images
- Most missing screenshots require actual Podio navigation to capture:
  - Stage detail pages with metrics
  - Contact reverse relationships
  - Submittal/RFI specific task views
  
### Documentation Quality
- All placeholders now have either:
  - ✅ A linked screenshot, OR
  - ⚠️ A clearly marked :::note block indicating what's needed

---

## Next Steps

1. **Capture remaining screenshots** (6 identified above)
2. **Review Stages section** (20 placeholders, 0 complete) - likely many reusable images exist
3. **Consider annotation needs** - some existing screenshots might benefit from callouts/highlights
4. **Update SCREENSHOT-TODO.md** after each batch of new captures

---

**Task completed:** Existing screenshots successfully linked to Tasks, Contacts, Submittals/RFIs/Change Orders, and Automations sections. All placeholders either resolved or clearly documented for future capture.
