# Pre-Construction Stage

**This is where you win or lose the project.**

Pre-Construction is the planning, permitting, and coordination phase. It's 75% of your project's success. Rush this stage and everything downstream suffers. Do it well and the rest is smooth sailing.

---

## What Is Pre-Construction?

Pre-Construction (Pre-Con) is everything that happens BEFORE your crew sets foot on the job site to start work.

**You're doing:**
- Reviewing contracts
- Getting permits
- Coordinating with the GC
- Submitting documents
- Answering RFIs
- Planning logistics
- Setting up safety
- Collecting required documents

**You're NOT doing:**
- Pouring concrete
- Setting rebar
- Running equipment

That comes later (Construction stage).

---

## When Does Pre-Con Start?

**Pre-Con starts the moment you create a project.**

When you create a new project and set **Current Stage Status** to **"Pre-Construction Active"**, tasks for this stage automatically populate.

![New project with Current Stage Status = "Pre-Construction Active"](/img/projects/detail-page/12-current-stage-status.png)

---

## How Many Tasks in Pre-Con?

**For Concrete division: ~46 tasks** (the most of any stage!)

[NEEDS VERIFICATION: Does Drywall division have a different task count for Pre-Con?]

Pre-Con has the most tasks because there's SO much coordination work.

## Major Categories of Pre-Con Work

### 1. Contract & LOI Review
Make sure you understand what you're signing up for.

**Tasks include:**
- Review LOI or Contract
- Identify scope, exclusions, and deliverables
- Flag any unclear items
- Confirm pricing and payment terms

**Why it matters:** Misunderstanding the scope leads to disputes, change orders, and lost profit.

---

### 2. Permits & Compliance
Get legal approval to work.

**Tasks include:**
- **811 Locate (Call Before You Dig)** - REQUIRED for any digging
  - Submit locate request
  - Wait for utility marking
  - Document locate ticket
- **Badging** - Get crew members badged for site access (if required by GC or site)
- **Site-Specific Safety Plan (SSSP)** - Create or update safety plan for this job
- Any local permits (building, grading, etc.)

**Why it matters:** You can't legally start work without these. Period.

### 3. Submittals
Submit your plans, materials, and methods to the GC for approval.

**Tasks include:**
- Prepare shop drawings (if required)
- Submit material specs
- Submit installation methods
- Wait for GC approval
- Resubmit if rejected

**Why it matters:** You can't order materials or start work until submittals are approved.

**Typical timeline:** 1-2 weeks (depends on GC responsiveness)

### 4. RFIs (Requests for Information)
Ask questions when the plans or scope aren't clear.

**Tasks include:**
- Identify unclear items in plans
- Draft RFI
- Submit to GC
- Wait for response
- Document answer

**Why it matters:** Don't guess. If something's unclear, ask. Better to delay 3 days for an RFI answer than to do it wrong and redo the work.

### 5. Scheduling & Coordination
Figure out when you're working and coordinate with other trades.

**Tasks include:**
- Get GC's master schedule
- Identify your work windows
- Coordinate with other trades (who's before you? who's after you?)
- Create internal crew schedule
- Order long-lead materials

**Why it matters:** You don't work in a vacuum. If the electrician is late, your pour might shift. Plan for it.

---

### 6. Document Collection
Gather everything you'll need for the project.

**Tasks include:**
- Get site plans
- Get soil reports (if applicable)
- Get structural drawings
- Get GC contact list
- Get site access info (gate codes, parking, etc.)

**Why it matters:** You can't execute without the right info. Collect it all up front.

![Documents & Logs field on project with uploaded files](/img/projects/creating-editing/21-documents-upload.png)

---

### 7. Safety Setup
Make sure the job site is safe BEFORE work starts.

**Tasks include:**
- Complete SSSP
- Conduct pre-job safety meeting
- Identify hazards
- Set up site safety measures (barriers, signage, etc.)
- Ensure crew has proper PPE

**Why it matters:** Safety isn't optional. Injuries cost time, money, and lives.

---

### 8. Logistics Planning
How is work actually going to happen?

**Tasks include:**
- Plan equipment needs (what, when, how many)
- Plan material delivery (where to stage, when to deliver)
- Plan crew size and schedule
- Plan site access and parking
- Identify constraints (narrow roads, overhead power lines, etc.)

**Why it matters:** Day 1 on site should NOT be the first time you think about where to park the truck.

---

## Task Dependencies in Pre-Con

Some Pre-Con tasks can't start until others are done. This is called **task dependency**.

**Example:**
- Task: "Order rebar" (Dependent)
- Depends on: "Submittal approved" (Independent)

You can't order materials until submittals are approved. Podio tracks this automatically.

When "Submittal approved" is marked Complete → "Order rebar" auto-advances to In Progress.

## Pre-Con Timeline

**How long does Pre-Con take?**

**Short answer:** 1-4 weeks, depending on complexity.

**Factors that speed it up:**
- Simple scope
- Responsive GC
- No permits required
- Standard materials (no custom fabrication)

**Factors that slow it down:**
- Complex scope
- Slow GC approvals
- Permit delays
- Custom materials with long lead times
- RFIs that take weeks to answer

**Don't rush it.** A 3-week Pre-Con that's thorough beats a 1-week Pre-Con that's sloppy.

## How to Know When Pre-Con Is Done

Pre-Con is "done" when:

✅ Contract/LOI is reviewed and understood  
✅ All permits and compliance items are in place (811, badging, SSSP)  
✅ All submittals are approved  
✅ All RFIs are answered  
✅ Schedule is locked in  
✅ Materials are ordered (or ready to order)  
✅ Safety is set up  
✅ Crew is assigned and briefed  
✅ Site access is confirmed  
✅ You have everything you need to mobilize  

**Check your tasks:** If all Pre-Con tasks are Complete (or the few remaining won't block Mobilization), you're ready to advance.

## Common Pre-Con Mistakes

### ❌ Rushing to Mobilization
**Problem:** "We got the contract, let's get on site!"  
**Result:** Show up on site without permits, no approved submittals, crew doesn't know the plan. Chaos.

**Fix:** Stay in Pre-Con until you're ACTUALLY ready.

---

### ❌ Skipping RFIs
**Problem:** "I think this is what they want…"  
**Result:** Do the work wrong, GC rejects it, you eat the cost of redoing it.

**Fix:** When in doubt, submit an RFI. Always.

---

### ❌ Not Tracking Dependencies
**Problem:** Try to order materials before submittals are approved.  
**Result:** Order the wrong stuff, or order gets rejected, or you waste time waiting.

**Fix:** Respect task dependencies. Let Podio guide the order of work.

---

### ❌ Forgetting 811 Locate
**Problem:** Start digging without calling 811.  
**Result:** Hit a utility line. Best case: work stoppage. Worst case: injury, fines, lawsuits.

**Fix:** ALWAYS call 811 before digging. It's the law.

---

### ❌ No Safety Plan
**Problem:** Show up on site without an SSSP or pre-job safety meeting.  
**Result:** GC kicks you off site, or worse, someone gets hurt.

**Fix:** Safety first. Always.

---

## Tips for Crushing Pre-Con

### 1. Start Day 1
Don't wait. As soon as the project is created, dive into Pre-Con tasks.

---

### 2. Batch Similar Tasks
**Example:** Do all your document requests in one email to the GC instead of 5 separate emails over 5 days.

---

### 3. Follow Up Relentlessly
Waiting on a submittal approval? Follow up every 2-3 days. Waiting on an RFI answer? Follow up. Don't let things sit.

---

### 4. Use Task Notes
When you hit a blocker, add a note to the task:
> "Waiting on GC to approve submittal. Emailed 1/15, followed up 1/18. Still pending."

This creates a paper trail and helps the next person understand what's happening.

### 5. Mark Blockers Clearly
If a task is blocked (waiting on someone else), note it. Don't let it disappear into the pile.

[NEEDS VERIFICATION: Is there a "Blocked" status option for tasks, or do you just add notes?]

---

### 6. Communicate with the Team
Pre-Con isn't a solo job. The PM, OC, FOCS, and Foreman all need to be in sync.

**Use Podio comments** on tasks to loop people in.  
**Have a Pre-Con kickoff meeting** to align everyone.

---

### 7. Don't Advance Until Ready
You'll feel pressure to move to Mobilization. Resist if you're not ready.

**Ask yourself:**
- Do I have all permits?
- Are submittals approved?
- Is the crew ready?
- Do I have materials ordered or ready to order?
- Is the schedule locked?

If ANY answer is no → stay in Pre-Con.

---

## Remember

**Pre-Construction is 75% of project success.**

Invest the time here. Plan well. Coordinate thoroughly. Get your ducks in a row.

The 30 minutes you spend now writing an RFI saves you 3 days of rework later.

The 2 hours you spend reviewing the contract now saves you from a costly dispute later.

The 1 week you spend waiting for permit approval now saves you from getting shut down on site later.

**Do Pre-Con right. Everything else gets easier.**
