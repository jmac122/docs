# How Stages Work

Every project goes through 5 stages, from planning to closeout. Think of stages like chapters in a book — each one has its own tasks, timeline, and goals.

---

## The 5 Stages

Every project follows this path:

```
1. Pre-Construction (Planning & Prep)
         ↓
2. Mobilization (Getting Set Up)
         ↓
3. Construction (Doing the Work)
         ↓
4. Demobilization (Wrapping Up)
         ↓
5. Retainage (Final Closeout)
```

You move through them in order. You can't skip stages.

## What Are Stages?

**Stages are separate records** linked to your project. When you create a project, Podio automatically creates all 5 stage records for you.

Think of them like folders — each stage holds its own tasks, dates, and notes.

## How Tasks Work with Stages

**All tasks are created automatically** when the project is created — not when each stage becomes active.

Here's the magic:
1. You set **Current Stage Status** to "[Stage Name] Active"
2. Wait 2-3 minutes
3. Tasks for that stage are already created (all tasks are created when the project is created)
4. Tasks appear in that stage's **Task Overview**

**Managing the task volume:** Since all tasks are created at once, use filters to view only tasks for your current stage. This keeps things focused without overwhelming you.

## Stage Breakdown

### 1. Pre-Construction (The Foundation)
**When:** Project just started, before any field work  
**Purpose:** Plan, permit, coordinate, and document everything  
**Duration:** Varies (days to weeks, depending on complexity)  
**% of Total Work:** ~75% of project success happens here!

**Major activities:**
- Contract review
- Permits and compliance (811, badging, SSSP)
- Submittals and RFIs
- Scheduling and coordination
- Document collection
- Safety setup

📍 **Most projects spend the longest time here.** Don't rush it.

### 2. Mobilization (Getting Ready to Work)
**When:** After Pre-Con is done, before actual construction starts  
**Purpose:** Get the site, equipment, and crew ready  
**Duration:** Usually 1-3 days  

**Major activities:**
- Site setup (fencing, trailers, utilities)
- Equipment delivery
- Crew assignment and briefing
- Final safety checks
- Material delivery coordination

---

### 3. Construction (Doing the Work)
**When:** Site is ready, crew is on-site  
**Purpose:** Execute the scope of work  
**Duration:** Varies (days to months)

**Major activities:**
- Daily work execution
- Daily reports
- Safety monitoring
- Progress tracking
- Quality control
- Material management
- Change order tracking

---

### 4. Demobilization (Wrapping Up)
**When:** Work is done or substantially complete  
**Purpose:** Clean up, return equipment, close out punch list  
**Duration:** Usually 1-2 days

**Major activities:**
- Site cleanup
- Equipment return
- Punch list completion
- Final inspections
- Crew demobilization
- Document handoff


---

### 5. Retainage (Final Closeout)
**When:** After Demob, waiting for final payment  
**Purpose:** Get paid, close out paperwork, archive project  
**Duration:** Varies (weeks to months, depends on GC payment terms)

**Major activities:**
- Final billing and invoicing
- Retainage collection
- Warranty tracking
- As-built document submission
- Project archiving
- Lessons learned capture


---

## Advancing to the Next Stage

**This is controlled by ONE field:** **Current Stage Status** on the project page.

When you're ready to move to the next stage:
1. Open the project
2. Change **Current Stage Status** to the next stage (e.g., "Mobilization Active")
3. Save

Tasks for all stages already exist — changing the stage just updates which phase you're tracking as active.

## How to View Stage Details

### From the Project Page

![Project page with Linked Stages field highlighted](/img/projects/detail-page/13-linked-stages.png)

1. Open your project
2. Scroll to **Linked Stages**
3. Click on any stage (e.g., "Pre-Construction")
4. The stage page opens, showing:
   - Stage Name
   - Estimated/Actual Dates
   - Task Overview (list of tasks for this stage)
   - Tasks Complete %
   - Open Issues count
   - Stage-specific notes

![Stage detail page showing tasks and completion metrics](/img/stages/stage-detail-full.png)

---

## Stage Status Tracking

Each stage tracks:

### Tasks Complete %
Shows how much of the stage is done. Calculated automatically based on completed tasks.

**Example:**
- Pre-Construction has 46 tasks
- You've completed 30 tasks
- Tasks Complete % = 65%

![Stage page showing Tasks Complete % field](/img/stages/stage-tasks-complete-pct.png)

---

### Open Issues
Count of incomplete tasks in this stage.

**Example:**
- Pre-Construction has 46 tasks total
- 30 are complete
- Open Issues = 16

Use this to see how much work is left.

---

### Estimated/Actual Dates
The actual dates are auto-filled from task completion dates. Estimated dates can be manually entered for planning.

Track when the stage was supposed to start/finish vs. when it actually did.

---

### Stage Specific Notes
Free-text field for any notes specific to this stage.

**Use it for:**
- Special instructions
- Issues encountered
- Lessons learned
- Anything future-you or the next person needs to know

![Stage Specific Notes field with example text](/img/stages/stage-notes-field.png)

---

## Automation Status Field

Each stage has an **Automation Status** field (usually hidden from view). This tracks the automation process:

- **"1 - Pending Creation"** - Tasks are about to be created
- **"2 - Creation Complete"** - Tasks have been created
- **"3 - Linking Complete"** - Task dependencies have been linked

**You don't need to touch this.** It's for the automation system to track its progress.

---

## Common Questions

### "Can I skip a stage?"
No. Every project goes through all 5 stages in order. Even if a stage takes 1 day, you still need to activate it.

**Why?** Each stage has critical tasks (safety, documentation, compliance). Skipping creates gaps.

---

### "Can I go back to a previous stage?"
Technically yes (you can change Current Stage Status back), but it won't delete the tasks you already created.

**Better approach:** If you need to do more Pre-Con work after starting Mobilization, just create a new task manually in the Pre-Construction stage. Don't mess with the stage status.

---

### "What if I'm in multiple stages at once?"
You're not. Only ONE stage is "Active" at a time (based on Current Stage Status).

**But:** You can still have open tasks in previous stages. That's normal.

**Example:**
- Current Stage Status = "Construction Active"
- You're working on construction tasks daily
- But you still have 2 open tasks from Pre-Construction (e.g., waiting on a submittal approval)

That's fine. Finish those Pre-Con tasks when you can. The stage status just controls where the project is "officially" at.

---

### "How long should each stage take?"
Depends on the project. Here's a rough guide:

| Stage | Typical Duration |
|-------|------------------|
| Pre-Construction | 1-4 weeks (varies widely) |
| Mobilization | 1-3 days |
| Construction | Days to months (depends on scope) |
| Demobilization | 1-2 days |
| Retainage | 2-8 weeks (waiting for payment) |

**Pre-Construction is the longest** because it involves permits, submittals, coordination — things that depend on external parties.

---

### "What if a stage is taking too long?"
Look at **Open Issues** for that stage. Which tasks are stuck? Why?

Common bottlenecks:
- **Pre-Con:** Waiting on permits or GC approvals
- **Mobilization:** Equipment delays
- **Construction:** Weather, material delays, crew availability
- **Demob:** Punch list items not addressed
- **Retainage:** GC payment processing

Identify the blocker and escalate if needed.

---

### "Can I delete a stage?"
No. And don't try. The 5 stages are core to how the system works.

If a stage doesn't apply to your project, you technically *can* skip it, but you shouldn't — follow the standard procedures and activate each stage in order, completing tasks quickly or marking them N/A if they don't apply.

---

## Tips for Managing Stages

### 1. Focus on One Stage at a Time
Don't try to work on all stages at once. Finish (or mostly finish) one stage before advancing to the next.

**Exception:** It's normal to have a few carryover tasks from previous stages while in a new stage.

---

### 2. Pre-Construction Is 75% of Success
The better you plan in Pre-Con, the smoother everything else goes. Don't rush it.

---

### 3. Use Stage Notes
When weird stuff happens, document it in **Stage Specific Notes**. Future projects will thank you.

**Example:**
> "GC required additional submittal not in original scope — added task manually. Delayed Mobilization by 3 days."

---

### 4. Check Open Issues Daily
Make it a habit to check **Open Issues** for your active stage. Tackle tasks before they become blockers.

---

### 5. Advance Deliberately
Don't advance to the next stage just because you're "mostly done." Finish critical tasks first.

**Ask yourself before advancing:**
- Are all safety items complete?
- Are all permits/approvals in place?
- Is the team ready?
- Are there any blockers that would prevent the next stage from starting?

If yes to all → advance. If no → finish those tasks first.
