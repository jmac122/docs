# Demobilization Stage

**Wrapping up the job site.**

Demobilization is the wind-down phase — the physical work is done, and now you're cleaning up, removing equipment, and preparing for final closeout.

---

## What Is Demobilization?

Demobilization is the cleanup and handoff phase. Construction is complete — now you're:

- Removing equipment and materials from site
- Cleaning up the job site
- Completing final inspections
- Addressing punch list items
- Gathering final documentation
- Coordinating final walkthroughs with GC

**Duration:** Typically 1-2 weeks, depending on job size and punch list complexity.

---

## When Does Demobilization Start?

**Demobilization starts when you advance from Construction.**

When Construction is substantially complete (scope work is done, GC has reviewed), you change **Current Stage Status** to **"Demobilization Active"**.

All tasks for this stage already exist (created when the project was created).

---

## Major Categories of Demobilization Work

### 1. Site Cleanup
Leave the site better than you found it.

**Tasks may include:**
- Remove all debris and waste materials
- Clean up work areas
- Remove temporary facilities (if you installed them)
- Grade and restore disturbed areas (if applicable)
- Final sweep/cleanup of your work zones

**Why it matters:** A clean site shows professionalism. GCs notice. Leaving a mess burns bridges.

---

### 2. Equipment Removal
Get your gear off-site efficiently.

**Tasks may include:**
- Inventory equipment on-site
- Schedule pickup/transport
- Inspect equipment for damage
- Return rental equipment
- Clean equipment before transport (some sites require this)

**Why it matters:** Equipment sitting on-site costs money (rental fees, tied-up capital). Get it off quickly.

**Tip:** Schedule equipment pickup early. Transport availability can be tight.

---

### 3. Material Handling
Account for leftover materials.

**Tasks may include:**
- Inventory remaining materials
- Return unused materials to vendor (if possible)
- Transfer reusable materials to next job
- Dispose of waste materials properly
- Document what was used vs. returned

**Why it matters:** Unused materials are money. Don't leave them behind or throw them away unnecessarily.

---

### 4. Final Inspections
Get official sign-off that the work is done right.

**Tasks may include:**
- Schedule city/county final inspection
- Attend inspection
- Address any inspection failures
- Obtain inspection approval documentation
- Coordinate third-party inspections (if required)

**Why it matters:** No inspection = no certificate of completion = no final payment. Don't skip this.

---

### 5. Punch List Items
Fix the small stuff the GC identified.

**Tasks may include:**
- Review punch list from GC walkthrough
- Prioritize and assign punch items
- Complete repairs/corrections
- Document completion with photos
- Get GC sign-off on punch list completion

**What's a punch list?**
A list of minor items to fix before final acceptance. Things like:
- Touch-up concrete repairs
- Fix a small crack
- Clean a stain
- Adjust something that's slightly off

**Why it matters:** Punch list items are the last hurdle before final acceptance. Complete them promptly.

**Tip:** Don't argue about small punch items. Just fix them. Getting paid is more important than being right about a $50 repair.

---

### 6. Final Walkthrough
Walk the site with the GC one last time.

**Tasks may include:**
- Schedule walkthrough with GC
- Walk all areas of your scope
- Document any remaining issues
- Get verbal or written acceptance
- Address any final concerns on the spot

**Why it matters:** This is your last chance to resolve issues face-to-face before it becomes a billing dispute.

---

### 7. Documentation Gathering
Collect all the paperwork.

**Tasks may include:**
- Gather all daily reports
- Compile inspection reports
- Collect material certifications
- Organize change order documentation
- Assemble as-built drawings (if applicable)
- Gather warranty information
- Compile photo documentation

**Why it matters:** Complete documentation protects you legally and speeds up final payment.

**Tip:** Don't wait until Retainage to gather docs. Start during Demobilization.

---

### 8. Safety Close-Out
Wrap up safety documentation.

**Tasks may include:**
- Complete final safety inspection
- Document any incidents that occurred (if not already done)
- Close out safety permits
- Return safety equipment (if rented/borrowed)
- File final safety reports

**Why it matters:** Safety documentation is often required for final project closeout.

---

## Demobilization Timeline

**How long does Demobilization take?**

**Typical:** 1-2 weeks

**Factors that affect duration:**
- Job size (bigger site = more to clean up)
- Punch list length (more items = more time)
- Equipment complexity (specialized equipment may need special transport)
- GC responsiveness (scheduling walkthroughs, getting punch lists)
- Inspection scheduling (city inspectors are often backlogged)

**Plan ahead.** Schedule inspections and equipment pickup as early as possible.

---

## How to Know When Demobilization Is Done

Demobilization is "done" when:

✅ Site is clean and all debris removed  
✅ All equipment is off-site  
✅ Leftover materials are accounted for (returned, transferred, or disposed)  
✅ Final inspections passed  
✅ Punch list items completed  
✅ GC has given final acceptance (verbal or written)  
✅ Documentation is gathered and organized  
✅ All Demobilization tasks are Complete

## Common Demobilization Mistakes

### ❌ Leaving Equipment Too Long
**Problem:** Equipment sits on-site for weeks after work is done.  
**Result:** Rental fees pile up, equipment ties up capital, GC gets annoyed.

**Fix:** Schedule equipment removal as soon as construction is substantially complete. Don't wait.

---

### ❌ Ignoring the Punch List
**Problem:** Blow off small punch items or argue about them.  
**Result:** GC holds final payment, relationship sours.

**Fix:** Just fix the punch items. Quickly. Smile. Move on.

---

### ❌ Skipping Final Inspections
**Problem:** Assume everything is fine, don't schedule inspections.  
**Result:** No official approval, can't close out permits, payment delayed.

**Fix:** Schedule inspections proactively. Attend them. Follow up on any issues.

---

### ❌ Leaving a Messy Site
**Problem:** Leave debris, materials, or trash behind.  
**Result:** GC has to clean up your mess, charges you back, doesn't hire you again.

**Fix:** Leave the site cleaner than you found it. Every time.

---

### ❌ Not Gathering Documentation
**Problem:** Wait until Retainage to collect paperwork.  
**Result:** Scrambling to find documents, delays in final billing, missing records.

**Fix:** Gather documentation throughout the job, finalize during Demobilization.

---

## Tips for Successful Demobilization

### 1. Start Planning Early
Don't wait until Construction is 100% done.

**When Construction is 90% complete:**
- Start scheduling equipment pickup
- Alert crew that demob is coming
- Review documentation gaps
- Schedule final inspections

---

### 2. Create a Punch List Checklist
When you do the walkthrough with GC:
- Write down every item
- Take photos of each item
- Assign responsibility
- Set deadlines
- Track completion

Don't rely on memory.

---

### 3. Document Everything with Photos
**Before demob:** Photo the site as you found it  
**During cleanup:** Photo progress  
**After demob:** Photo the clean site  

**Why:** If GC claims you left a mess, you have proof.

---

### 4. Communicate with GC
**Schedule proactively:**
- "When would you like to do the final walkthrough?"
- "We're planning to have equipment off by [date]."
- "Final inspection is scheduled for [date]."

Keep GC informed. No surprises.

---

### 5. Don't Rush Safety Close-Out
Incidents can still happen during demob.

**Keep safety protocols in place until:**
- All equipment is off-site
- All personnel are gone
- Site is fully handed over

---

## What Happens After Demobilization?

Once Demobilization is done, you advance to **Retainage** — the final closeout stage where you handle billing, collect retainage, and archive the project.

Change **Current Stage Status** to **"Retainage Active"** when ready.
