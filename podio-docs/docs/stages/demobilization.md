# Demobilization Stage

**Wrapping up the job site.**

Demobilization is when the physical work is complete and you're cleaning up, removing equipment, and preparing to hand off.

## What Is Demobilization?

Demobilization is the wind-down phase. The construction work is done — now you're:

- Removing equipment from site
- Cleaning up the job site
- Completing final inspections
- Handling punch list items
- Gathering final documentation
- Coordinating final walkthroughs

**Duration:** Typically 1-2 weeks, depending on job size.

## When Does Demobilization Start?

**Demobilization starts when you advance from Construction.**

When Construction is substantially complete, you change **Current Stage Status** to **"Demobilization Active"**.

All tasks for this stage already exist (created when the project was created).

## Key Demobilization Tasks

Common tasks during Demobilization include:

- **Site cleanup** - Remove debris, materials, equipment
- **Equipment removal** - Get your gear off-site
- **Final inspections** - City/county final inspection
- **Punch list** - Address any remaining items
- **Documentation** - Gather as-builts, warranties, etc.
- **Final walkthrough** - With customer/GC

## What Happens After Demobilization?

When Demobilization is complete, you advance to **Retainage** — the final closeout stage where you handle billing, collect retainage, and archive the project.

Change **Current Stage Status** to **"Retainage Active"** when ready.
