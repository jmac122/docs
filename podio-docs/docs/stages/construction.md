# Construction Stage

**This is where the work happens.**

Construction is the active work phase — your crew is on-site, executing the scope, pouring concrete, setting rebar, doing the job you were hired to do.

---

## What Is Construction?

Construction is the execution phase. All the planning (Pre-Con) and setup (Mobilization) were prep. Now you're actually doing the work.

**You're doing:**
- Daily work execution (pour concrete, set rebar, grade, etc.)
- Daily reports and progress tracking
- Safety monitoring
- Quality control
- Material management
- Coordinating with other trades
- Tracking change orders
- Solving field issues as they arise

**Duration:** Varies widely — could be days, weeks, or months depending on the scope.

---

## When Does Construction Start?

**Construction starts when you advance from Mobilization.**

When Mobilization is done (site is set up, crew is ready, equipment is on-site), you change **Current Stage Status** to **"Construction Active"**.

Within 2-3 minutes, Podio creates tasks for Construction.

## How Many Tasks in Construction?

[NEEDS VERIFICATION: How many tasks are in Construction for Concrete division? Drywall division?]

Construction tasks vary widely depending on the scope. Some are recurring (daily reports), others are one-time (final inspection).

## Major Categories of Construction Work

### 1. Daily Work Execution
The actual scope of work.

**Tasks are specific to your division and scope:**
- **Concrete:** Pour foundations, set forms, place rebar, finish flatwork, cure concrete
- **Earthwork:** Grade site, excavate, compact fill
- **Utilities:** Install pipes, backfill trenches
- **Drywall:** Hang drywall, tape, finish [NEEDS VERIFICATION]

**Why it matters:** This is what you're getting paid for. Execute it right.

### 2. Daily Reports
Track what happened each day.

**Tasks may include:**
- Complete daily work log
- Document crew hours
- Record equipment usage
- Note weather conditions
- Document work completed
- Flag issues or delays
- Take progress photos

**Why it matters:**
- Proves work was done (documentation for billing)
- Tracks progress against schedule
- Creates a record if disputes arise
- Helps with future estimating

**Tip:** Don't skip daily reports. Do them at the end of each day while it's fresh. Trying to recreate them a week later is painful and inaccurate.

---

### 3. Safety Monitoring
Keep the site safe every single day.

**Tasks may include:**
- Daily safety inspections
- Toolbox talks (ongoing safety discussions)
- Incident reporting (if anything happens)
- PPE checks
- Hazard identification and mitigation

**Why it matters:** Construction is dangerous. Vigilance saves lives.

**Never skip safety.** Ever.

---

### 4. Quality Control
Make sure the work meets standards.

**Tasks may include:**
- Inspect work before it's covered/finalized
- Verify dimensions and placement
- Test materials (concrete slump tests, compaction tests, etc.)
- Document inspections
- Third-party inspections (if required by GC or code)

**Why it matters:** Catching quality issues early is cheap. Catching them after the GC rejects the work is expensive.

---

### 5. Material Management
Keep materials flowing and organized.

**Tasks may include:**
- Order additional materials as needed
- Coordinate deliveries (schedule and location)
- Verify delivered quantities
- Track material usage
- Return unused materials (if applicable)

**Why it matters:** Running out of concrete mid-pour is a disaster. Stay ahead of material needs.

---

### 6. Progress Tracking
Know where you are vs. where you should be.

**Tasks may include:**
- Update percent complete
- Compare actual progress to schedule
- Identify delays and causes
- Communicate progress to PM and GC

**Why it matters:** If you're falling behind, you need to know NOW so you can course-correct.

![Progress tracking task or field](/img/projects/detail-page/14-progress-tasks-count.png)

---

### 7. Change Order Tracking
Scope changes? Track them.

**Tasks may include:**
- Identify scope changes (work not in original contract)
- Document the change
- Submit change order request to GC
- Track approval status
- Document extra work performed

**Why it matters:** Extra work = extra money. Don't do free work. Track every change order.

[NEEDS VERIFICATION: Is there a separate Change Order app or workflow in Podio?]

---

### 8. Coordination with Other Trades
Construction is a team sport.

**Tasks may include:**
- Daily coordination with GC superintendent
- Coordinate with trades before/after you (who needs access when?)
- Resolve conflicts (e.g., electrician needs access to area you're working in)
- Attend coordination meetings

**Why it matters:** You're not the only trade on-site. Play nice, communicate, stay flexible.

---

### 9. Issue Resolution
Problems will arise. Deal with them.

**Tasks may include:**
- Identify field issues (conflicts, unforeseen conditions, etc.)
- Escalate to PM or GC
- Implement solutions
- Document resolution

**Why it matters:** Construction never goes 100% to plan. How you handle issues determines success.

**Tip:** Don't hide problems. Surface them early, solve them fast.

---

## Recurring Tasks in Construction

Some Construction tasks happen repeatedly:

**Examples:**
- Daily work log (every day)
- Weekly safety meeting (every week)
- Weekly progress photos (every week)

**How it works:** Podio can auto-create recurring tasks on a schedule (e.g., every Monday).

[NEEDS VERIFICATION: How exactly do recurring tasks work? Are they duplicated weekly via GlobiFlow automation?]

---

## Task Dependencies in Construction

Some Construction tasks depend on others.

**Example:**
- Can't pour concrete until forms are set and inspected
- Can't backfill until utilities are installed and inspected

Podio tracks these dependencies.

## Construction Timeline

**How long does Construction take?**

**It varies wildly.**

**Small job (foundation pour):** 1-3 days  
**Medium job (site utilities):** 1-2 weeks  
**Large job (full site development):** Weeks to months

**Factors:**
- Scope size
- Complexity
- Weather
- Crew size
- Material availability
- Other trades' schedules
- Change orders

**Plan for delays.** Weather, material delays, and coordination issues WILL happen.

---

## How to Know When Construction Is Done

Construction is "done" when:

✅ All work in the scope is complete  
✅ Quality inspections passed  
✅ GC has accepted the work (or identified punch list items)  
✅ Daily reports are up to date  
✅ All change orders are documented  
✅ Site is ready for demobilization  

**Note:** You might still have punch list items (minor fixes). That's normal. Handle them in Demobilization.

## Common Construction Mistakes

### ❌ Skipping Daily Reports
**Problem:** "I'll do them all at the end of the week."  
**Result:** You forget details, reports are inaccurate, you can't prove work was done.

**Fix:** Do daily reports daily. 10 minutes at the end of each day. Non-negotiable.

---

### ❌ Not Tracking Change Orders
**Problem:** GC asks for extra work, you do it, but never document it.  
**Result:** You did free work. GC doesn't pay for it.

**Fix:** When scope changes, STOP. Document it. Submit a change order. Get approval. Then do the work.

---

### ❌ Ignoring Safety
**Problem:** "We're in a hurry, skip the toolbox talk."  
**Result:** Someone gets hurt.

**Fix:** Never skip safety. Ever. No schedule is worth an injury.

---

### ❌ Poor Communication with GC
**Problem:** Don't tell GC about delays, issues, or progress.  
**Result:** GC is blindsided, trust erodes, disputes arise.

**Fix:** Over-communicate. Daily check-ins. Weekly updates. Keep GC in the loop.

---

### ❌ Running Out of Materials
**Problem:** Didn't order enough rebar, concrete, etc.  
**Result:** Work stops mid-task, crew sits idle, money wasted.

**Fix:** Track material usage. Order ahead. Have buffer stock for critical items.

---

### ❌ No Quality Checks
**Problem:** Rush the work, don't inspect it.  
**Result:** GC rejects it, you have to redo it, lose time and money.

**Fix:** Inspect as you go. Catch issues early.

## Tips for Successful Construction

### 1. Start Each Day with a Plan
**Morning huddle:** 5-10 minutes with the crew.
- What are we doing today?
- Who's doing what?
- Any safety concerns?
- Any materials or equipment issues?

Sets the tone for the day.

---

### 2. End Each Day with a Report
**Daily wrap-up:** 10 minutes at end of day.
- What did we complete?
- What's left?
- Any issues?
- What's the plan for tomorrow?

Document it in your daily report.

---

### 3. Take Photos Daily
**Why:**
- Proves work was done
- Documents progress
- Useful for disputes
- Helps with future estimates

**What to photo:**
- Work in progress
- Completed work before it's covered (e.g., rebar before concrete pour)
- Issues or defects
- Site conditions (weather, access, etc.)

![Task for taking daily progress photos](/img/projects/detail-page/14-progress-tasks-count.png)

**Tip:** Store photos in Podio (upload to Documents & Logs on the project).

---

### 4. Communicate, Communicate, Communicate
**Daily:** Check in with GC superintendent  
**Weekly:** Send progress update to PM  
**Immediately:** Report issues, delays, or safety incidents

**Over-communication beats under-communication every time.**

---

### 5. Track Time and Costs
Know how much time and money you're spending vs. budget.

**If you're going over:**
- Why? (Change orders? Inefficiency? Unforeseen conditions?)
- Can you course-correct?
- Do you need to escalate?

![Budget tracking field or task](/img/projects/detail-page/10-budget-fields.png)

---

### 6. Solve Problems Fast
When issues arise:
1. Identify the problem
2. Escalate if needed (to PM, GC, or engineer)
3. Implement solution quickly
4. Document what happened and how you fixed it

**Don't let issues fester.** Small problems become big problems if ignored.

---

### 7. Manage the Crew
**Your foreman is critical.**

Support them:
- Make sure they have what they need (materials, equipment, info)
- Back them up on safety decisions
- Listen when they flag issues
- Recognize good work

A good foreman = a successful job.

---

### 8. Respect Other Trades
You're sharing the site.

**Be courteous:**
- Clean up your mess
- Don't block access
- Coordinate schedules
- Communicate when you need space

**Karma is real on construction sites.** Help others, they'll help you.
