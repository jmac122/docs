# Retainage Stage

**Final closeout and getting paid.**

Retainage is the final stage — the work is done, the site is cleared, and now you're handling the business side: collecting final payment, releasing retainage, and archiving the project.

## What Is Retainage?

Retainage is the financial and administrative closeout. The physical work is complete. Now you're:

- Submitting final invoices
- Collecting retainage (the % held back until completion)
- Closing out purchase orders
- Finalizing all documentation
- Archiving project files
- Closing out the project in Podio

**Duration:** Can take weeks to months, depending on payment terms and customer.

## When Does Retainage Start?

**Retainage starts when you advance from Demobilization.**

When Demobilization is complete (site is clean, equipment is gone, punch list is done), you change **Current Stage Status** to **"Retainage Active"**.

All tasks for this stage already exist (created when the project was created).

## Key Retainage Tasks

Common tasks during Retainage include:

- **Final billing** - Submit final invoice
- **Retainage collection** - Follow up on held funds
- **Lien releases** - File and collect as needed
- **Documentation** - Ensure all close-out docs are complete
- **Project archival** - Move files to archive folders
- **Lessons learned** - Document what went well/poorly

## What Happens After Retainage?

Retainage is the final stage. When complete:

1. Ensure all payments are collected
2. Archive project documentation
3. Change **Current Stage Status** to **"Complete"** or **"Closed"**

The project is done!
