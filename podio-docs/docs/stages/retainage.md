# Retainage Stage

**Final closeout and getting paid.**

Retainage is the final stage — the work is done, the site is cleared, and now you're handling the business side: final billing, collecting retainage, and archiving the project.

---

## What Is Retainage?

Retainage is the financial and administrative closeout. The physical work is complete. Now you're:

- Submitting final invoices
- Collecting retainage (the % held back until project completion)
- Closing out purchase orders
- Finalizing all documentation
- Resolving any disputes
- Archiving project files
- Closing out the project in Podio

**Duration:** Can take weeks to months, depending on payment terms, customer, and any outstanding issues.

---

## What Is Retainage (The Money)?

**Retainage** is a percentage of each payment that the GC/owner holds back until the project is complete.

**Typical:** 5-10% of each invoice

**Example:**
- You bill $100,000 throughout the project
- GC retains 10% ($10,000)
- You've received $90,000 during Construction
- In Retainage stage, you collect that final $10,000

**Why it exists:** Protects the GC/owner — if you don't finish the job, they have money to hire someone else to complete it.

**Why it matters to you:** This is YOUR money. Don't forget about it. Don't let it sit uncollected.

---

## When Does Retainage Start?

**Retainage starts when you advance from Demobilization.**

When Demobilization is complete (site is clean, equipment is gone, punch list is done, GC accepted the work), you change **Current Stage Status** to **"Retainage Active"**.

All tasks for this stage already exist (created when the project was created).

---

## Major Categories of Retainage Work

### 1. Final Billing
Submit your last invoice.

**Tasks may include:**
- Calculate final amounts owed
- Include any outstanding change orders
- Submit final invoice to GC
- Include all required documentation with invoice
- Follow up on invoice receipt

**Why it matters:** You can't get paid if you don't bill. Submit promptly.

**Tip:** Make sure your final invoice matches your contract amount (plus approved change orders). Discrepancies delay payment.

---

### 2. Retainage Collection
Get that held-back money.

**Tasks may include:**
- Submit retainage release request
- Provide required close-out documents
- Follow up on retainage payment status
- Escalate if payment is delayed

**When can you collect retainage?**
Usually when:
- All work is complete
- All punch items are done
- Final inspections passed
- GC/owner has accepted the work
- Required documentation is submitted

**How long does it take?**
Varies widely:
- Good customers: 30-60 days after final acceptance
- Slow customers: 90+ days
- Problem projects: Can take months of chasing

**Tip:** Start following up early. Don't wait 90 days to realize they "lost" your paperwork.

---

### 3. Close-Out Documentation
Submit the final paperwork package.

**Common close-out documents:**
- Final lien waiver/release
- Warranty documentation
- As-built drawings (if applicable)
- Material certifications
- Inspection reports
- Maintenance manuals (if applicable)
- Final photos

**Why it matters:** Many GCs won't release retainage until they have complete documentation.

**Tip:** Find out what documents are required BEFORE Retainage. Gather them during Demobilization.

---

### 4. Lien Releases
Prove you've been paid (or will be).

**Types:**
- **Conditional lien release:** "I'll release my lien rights when this check clears"
- **Unconditional lien release:** "I've been paid, I release my lien rights"

**Tasks may include:**
- Submit conditional release with final invoice
- Submit unconditional release after payment received
- Obtain lien releases from any subcontractors you used

**Why it matters:** GCs typically require lien releases before releasing final payment. Protects them from mechanics liens.

---

### 5. Purchase Order Close-Out
Clean up the financial loose ends.

**Tasks may include:**
- Review all POs for the project
- Verify all materials received and paid for
- Close out completed POs
- Reconcile any discrepancies
- Return deposits (if applicable)

**Why it matters:** Open POs can cause accounting headaches. Close them out.

---

### 6. Dispute Resolution
Handle any outstanding issues.

**Tasks may include:**
- Review any disputed charges
- Negotiate resolution
- Document agreements
- Adjust final billing if needed
- Escalate to management if needed

**Common disputes:**
- Back-charges from GC (damage, cleanup, delays)
- Disputed change orders
- Quantity disagreements
- Quality claims

**Tip:** Try to resolve disputes before submitting final billing. It's easier to negotiate when they still owe you money.

---

### 7. Project Archival
Organize and store project records.

**Tasks may include:**
- Organize all project files
- Move files to archive location (Google Drive archive folder)
- Ensure all photos are saved
- Archive Podio project
- Document lessons learned

**Why it matters:** You may need these records later for:
- Warranty claims
- Legal disputes
- Future similar projects (estimating reference)
- Tax/audit purposes

**How long to keep records?**
- At minimum: Length of warranty period + statute of limitations (often 6-10 years)
- Best practice: Keep forever (storage is cheap)

---

### 8. Lessons Learned
What went well? What didn't?

**Tasks may include:**
- Hold debrief meeting with PM and key crew
- Document what worked well
- Document what went wrong
- Identify process improvements
- Share learnings with team

**Questions to ask:**
- Did we make money on this job?
- Where did we lose time/money?
- What would we do differently?
- Were there any safety issues?
- Would we work with this GC again?

**Why it matters:** Every job is a learning opportunity. Capture those learnings.

---

## Retainage Timeline

**How long does Retainage take?**

**Best case:** 30-60 days  
**Typical:** 60-90 days  
**Problem projects:** 6+ months

**Factors that affect duration:**
- Customer payment terms
- Documentation completeness
- Disputes or issues
- GC's own cash flow
- Project owner's approval process

**Tip:** Start following up on retainage at 30 days. Don't assume it will just show up.

## How to Know When Retainage Is Complete

Retainage is "done" when:

✅ Final invoice submitted  
✅ All payments received (including retainage)  
✅ All lien releases exchanged  
✅ All close-out documentation submitted  
✅ All disputes resolved  
✅ Project files archived  
✅ Lessons learned documented  
✅ All Retainage tasks Complete

## Common Retainage Mistakes

### ❌ Forgetting About Retainage
**Problem:** Project ends, you move on, forget to chase retainage.  
**Result:** Money sits uncollected for months. Or forever.

**Fix:** Track retainage as actively as you track progress payments. Set reminders.

---

### ❌ Incomplete Documentation
**Problem:** Can't find inspection reports, missing lien releases, etc.  
**Result:** GC won't release retainage until you provide docs. Delays payment.

**Fix:** Gather documentation throughout the job. Have it ready before you ask for retainage.

---

### ❌ Not Following Up
**Problem:** Submit final invoice, assume payment will come.  
**Result:** Invoice gets lost in the shuffle. Payment delayed indefinitely.

**Fix:** Follow up at 30 days, 45 days, 60 days. Be politely persistent.

---

### ❌ Burning Bridges Over Small Amounts
**Problem:** Fight aggressively over disputed $500 back-charge.  
**Result:** Win the battle, lose the war. GC never hires you again.

**Fix:** Pick your battles. Sometimes eating a small loss is worth preserving the relationship.

---

### ❌ Not Archiving Properly
**Problem:** Delete files, lose records, can't find anything later.  
**Result:** No documentation when warranty claim comes in 2 years later.

**Fix:** Archive everything. Storage is cheap. Lawsuits are expensive.

## Tips for Successful Retainage

### 1. Know the Payment Terms
**Before** you start the job, know:
- What % retainage?
- When is retainage released?
- What documentation is required?
- Who approves payment?

Don't be surprised at the end.

---

### 2. Track Retainage Separately
Know exactly how much retainage is owed on every project.

**Track:**
- Total contract value
- Total billed
- Total received
- Retainage held
- Retainage collected

Don't let money slip through the cracks.

---

### 3. Submit Documentation Proactively
Don't wait for GC to ask.

**As soon as Demobilization is done:**
- "Here's our final invoice"
- "Here's our conditional lien release"
- "Here's the close-out documentation package"
- "What else do you need?"

Being proactive speeds up payment.

---

### 4. Follow Up Consistently
**Create a follow-up schedule:**
- Day 1: Submit final invoice + docs
- Day 14: "Just confirming you received everything"
- Day 30: "Checking on payment status"
- Day 45: "Any issues holding this up?"
- Day 60: Escalate to your management + their management

Be polite but persistent.

---

### 5. Build Relationships with AP
The accounts payable person often controls when checks go out.

**Be nice to them:**
- Learn their name
- Be patient when they have questions
- Make their job easy (complete paperwork, clear invoices)

AP people remember who's pleasant to work with.

---

### 6. Document Everything
If there are disputes or issues:
- Email, don't just call (creates paper trail)
- Save all correspondence
- Document agreements in writing
- Get sign-offs

If it's not in writing, it didn't happen.
