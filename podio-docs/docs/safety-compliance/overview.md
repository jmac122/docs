# Safety & Compliance

**Tracking OSHA compliance and safety requirements for every project.**

The Safety & Compliance app is where you manage all safety-related tasks and documentation for a project. Every project gets a Safety & Compliance item automatically.

---

## What Is Safety & Compliance?

Safety & Compliance tracks everything related to OSHA regulations and job site safety requirements:

- Site safety plans (SSSP)
- 811 Line Locates (utility marking)
- Equipment certifications
- Badging requirements
- General safety documentation

**Why it matters:** OSHA compliance isn't optional. Missing safety requirements can shut down a job, result in fines, or worse — get someone hurt.

---

## How It's Created

**You don't create Safety & Compliance items manually.**

When a project is created, a Safety & Compliance item is automatically created and linked to that project. It comes pre-loaded with the relevant safety tasks.

## Compliance Types

### 811 Line Locate
Before you dig, you must call 811 to have underground utilities marked.

**Related tasks:**
- Initial 811 Line Locate
- Request 811 Line Locate Remarks

**Why it matters:** Hitting a gas line or electrical conduit can be fatal. And expensive. Always call before you dig.

---

### SSSP (Site-Specific Safety Plan)
A safety plan tailored to this specific job site.

**Related tasks:**
- Compose Safety Forms
- Submit SSSP to GC

**Why it matters:** GCs often require an SSSP before you can start work. It documents hazards and safety procedures for this specific site.

---

### Badging
Some job sites require workers to have badges or certifications.

**Related tasks:**
- Verify badging requirements
- Submit badge applications
- Track badge status

**Why it matters:** No badge = no site access. Make sure your crew is badged before mobilization.

---

### General Safety
Catch-all for other safety requirements.

**Related tasks:**
- Submit Equipment Certifications to GC
- Verify All Subcontractors have a Master Agreement On File
- Upload safety deliverables to Project Drive Folder

**Why it matters:** Covers everything that doesn't fit neatly into the other categories.

---

## Common Safety Tasks

Based on the project, you'll see tasks like:

| Task | Description |

## Tips for Safety & Compliance

### 1. Don't Skip 811
**Ever.** Even if you "know" there's nothing underground. Call 811. Wait for the marks. Document it.

### 2. Submit SSSP Early
Don't wait until mobilization day. Submit your SSSP as soon as you have site details. GCs often take time to review.

### 3. Keep Certifications Current
Equipment certifications expire. Track expiration dates. Renew before they lapse.

### 4. Document Everything
If OSHA shows up, you want a paper trail showing you did everything right.

### 5. Train Your Crew
Safety plans are useless if the crew doesn't know them. Review safety requirements before starting work.

## Remember

**Safety isn't bureaucracy — it's protecting people.**

Complete safety tasks on time:
- Call 811 before digging
- Submit SSSPs early
- Keep certifications current
- Document everything

**No schedule is worth an injury. No shortcut is worth a life.**
