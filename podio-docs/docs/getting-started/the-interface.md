## The Sidebar (Left Side)

This is your main navigation:

|-----------|--------------|
| **Home** | Your activity feed - recent updates |
| **Apps** | List of all apps (Projects, Tasks, etc.) |
| **Tasks** | Quick view of tasks assigned to you |
| **Calendar** | Tasks and events on a calendar |

## The Top Bar

- **Search** - Find anything (projects, tasks, contacts)
- **🔔 Bell Icon** - Your notifications
- **Profile Picture** - Settings, log out

## The Main Content Area

This changes based on what you're doing:
- Viewing an app → Shows list of items
- Viewing an item → Shows all the details
- Home → Shows activity feed

## Quick Tips

### Getting Around

### Finding Things Fast
