# Searching and Filtering

## Using Search

The search bar is at the top of every page.

### How to Search

1. Click the search bar (or press `/` on your keyboard)
2. Type what you're looking for:
   - Job number: `5172`
   - Job name: `MD Anderson`
   - Person's name: `John Smith`
   - Anything else
3. Press **Enter** or click a result

### Search Tips

- **Be specific** — "5172" finds faster than "Anderson project"
- **Partial matches work** — "ander" will find "MD Anderson"
- **Search finds everything** — projects, tasks, contacts, comments

## Using Filters

Filters help you narrow down lists in any app.

### How to Filter

1. Open an app (like Projects)
2. Look for the **Filter** button (usually top of the list)
3. Click it and choose your criteria:
   - By status
   - By person assigned
   - By date
   - By any field

### Example: Find Your Active Projects

1. Go to **Projects** app
2. Click **Filter**
3. Set: "Project Manager" = *your name*
4. Set: "Status" = "Active"
5. Click **Apply**

Now you only see your active projects.

### Saving Filters (Views)

If you use the same filter often:

1. Set up your filter
2. Click **Save View** (or the ⭐ star icon)
3. Give it a name like "My Active Projects"
4. Next time, just click that saved view

## Common Filters You'll Use

| What You Want | How to Filter |
|---------------|---------------|
| My tasks | Tasks app → Responsible = *you* |
| Overdue tasks | Tasks app → Due Date = Before today |
| Projects in Pre-Con | Projects app → Current Stage = Pre-Construction |
| Jobs for a specific GC | Projects app → Customer = *GC name* |
