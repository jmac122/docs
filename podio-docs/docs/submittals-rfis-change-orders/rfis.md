# Managing RFIs (Requests for Information) in Podio

## What Is an RFI?

An RFI is a formal question you ask the General Contractor (GC) when something on the plans or specs is unclear. Think of it as: "We need clarification before we can proceed."

**Common RFI scenarios:**
- Plans show conflicting dimensions
- Material specification is vague
- Detail is missing from drawings
- Site condition doesn't match plans

RFIs are normal. Better to ask now than guess wrong and have to redo work later.

## Where RFIs Live

RFIs are tracked as **Tasks** in the **Pre-Construction Stage** (and sometimes **Construction Stage**) of your project.

## How to Create and Track an RFI

### 1. Create an RFI Task

**If there's already an RFI task template:**
1. Open your **Project**
2. Go to the **Pre-Construction** (or **Construction**) stage
3. Find the RFI task in the **Task Overview**
4. Open it and skip to step 2

**If you need to create a new RFI task:**
1. Open the appropriate **Stage** (Pre-Construction or Construction)
2. In the **Task Overview** section, click **"Add Task"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Task Name:** "RFI: [Brief Description]" (e.g., "RFI: Foundation depth at Grid Line B")
   - **Status:** In Progress (yellow)
   - **Responsible:** Person handling the RFI (usually PM or OC)
   - **Type:** Task
4. Save

### 2. Document the Question

1. Open the RFI task
2. In the **Notes** field, write:
   - **What's unclear** (be specific)
   - **Where it's located** (drawing number, page, grid line, etc.)
   - **Why it matters** (how it affects your work)
   - **Date you submitted the RFI**
   - **Who you sent it to** (GC contact name)

**Example Note:**
```
RFI #3 - Foundation Depth Discrepancy
Drawing S-101 shows 4' depth, but S-102 shows 3'-6" depth at Grid B.
Need clarification before excavation starts.
Submitted to John Smith (GC) via email on 3/10/2024.
```

3. **Attach documentation:** Upload any relevant photos, drawing markups, or emails to the **Attachments** field

### 3. Track the Response

**When the GC responds:**
1. Add the response to the **Notes** field with the date
2. Upload their response (email, marked-up drawing, etc.) to **Attachments**
3. Change **Status** to "Complete" (green)

**Example update:**
```
Response received 3/12/2024 from John Smith:
Use 4' depth per S-101. S-102 will be revised in next plan set.
```

### 4. Handle Dependencies

If other tasks are waiting on this RFI answer:
- When you mark the RFI task **Complete**, dependent tasks will automatically advance to "In Progress"
- The responsible person gets notified

**Example:** "Pour Foundation" task depends on "RFI: Foundation Depth" being answered first.

## Best Practices

✅ **Number your RFIs:** Use "RFI #1", "RFI #2" in the task name so you can reference them easily

✅ **Be specific:** Vague questions get vague answers. Include drawing numbers, locations, and what decision you need

✅ **Document everything:** Upload the question AND the answer. This protects you if issues come up later

✅ **Track timing:** Note when you asked and when they responded. Delays on RFI answers can justify schedule extensions

✅ **Set Due Dates:** Add a realistic due date so you know when to follow up if there's no response

## Common Questions

**Q: How long should I wait for an RFI response?**  
A: Typical turnaround is 5-10 business days, but check your contract. Follow up if you don't hear back. Document your follow-ups in the Notes.

**Q: What if the GC's answer creates more work?**  
A: That might be grounds for a Change Order Request (COR). Document the original scope vs. the new requirement and discuss with your PM.

**Q: Can I call instead of writing an RFI?**  
A: Verbal questions are fine for quick clarifications, but **always document the answer in Podio**. If it's important enough to affect schedule or cost, write a formal RFI.

**Q: Where do I see all open RFIs?**  
A: Filter the Task Overview for "RFI" in the name, or filter by Status = "In Progress". [NEEDS VERIFICATION: Exact filter UI]
