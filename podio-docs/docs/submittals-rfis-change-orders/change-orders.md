# Creating and Tracking Change Order Requests in Podio

## What Is a Change Order?

A Change Order Request (COR) is how you formally ask the General Contractor (GC) for additional money or time when the scope of work changes.

**Common reasons for a COR:**
- GC asks for work not in the original contract
- Site conditions differ from what was shown in plans
- Design changes mid-project
- RFI response requires extra work
- Schedule delays caused by others

**Important:** A COR protects you. If the work isn't in your contract and you do it anyway, you might not get paid for it.

## Where Change Orders Live

Change Order Requests are tracked as **Tasks**, usually in the **Construction Stage** (but can appear in any stage where extra work comes up).

## How to Create a Change Order Request

### Step 1: Create the COR Task

1. Open your **Project** in Podio
2. Navigate to the appropriate **Stage** (usually Construction)
3. In the **Task Overview**, click **"Add Task"**
4. Fill in the task details:
   - **Task Name:** "COR: [Brief Description]" (e.g., "COR: Additional excavation for utilities")
   - **Status:** In Progress (yellow)
   - **Responsible:** Project Manager (PM) or person handling the negotiation
   - **Type:** Task
   - **Due Date:** When you need a response (give them reasonable time)
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Document the Change

In the **Notes** field, document:
1. **What changed:** Describe the extra work or condition clearly
2. **Why it's extra work:** Reference the original contract/drawings to show this wasn't included
3. **Impact:** How much extra time/cost it will add
4. **When requested:** Date the GC asked for it (or when you discovered the condition)
5. **Reference numbers:** Link to related RFIs, emails, or meeting notes

**Example Note:**
```
COR #5 - Additional Excavation for Unforeseen Utilities
Original plans showed no utilities in this area (see Drawing C-101).
During excavation on 4/2/2024, discovered unmarked water line.
Additional work required:
  - Hand dig around utility
  - Reroute our work to avoid conflict
  - 2 extra days schedule impact
Estimated cost: $3,500 labor + $1,200 equipment
Total COR amount: $4,700
Submitted to GC Sarah Johnson on 4/3/2024.
```

### Step 3: Attach Supporting Documentation

Upload to the **Attachments** field:
- Photos of the condition or change
- Email requests from the GC
- Marked-up drawings
- Cost breakdowns (labor, materials, equipment)
- Schedule impact analysis

More documentation = stronger case for approval.

### Step 4: Track the Approval Process

**While waiting for approval:**
- Keep **Status** as "In Progress" (yellow)
- Add notes when you follow up: "Followed up with Sarah on 4/10/2024"
- Document any verbal responses or negotiations

**When the GC responds:**
- If **approved:** 
  - Change **Status** to "Complete" (green)
  - Add note: "Approved for $4,700 on 4/12/2024 via email"
  - Upload the approval email/signed change order
  - Update the **Contract Value** field in the main Project if instructed by PM
- If **rejected:**
  - Add note explaining why it was rejected
  - Discuss with PM whether to revise and resubmit
  - Keep Status as "In Progress" if negotiating, or change to "Complete" if you're moving on
- If **negotiated:**
  - Document the back-and-forth in Notes
  - Update the final agreed amount when settled

### Step 5: Link to Project Budget

After approval, your PM or OC will update:
- **Contract Value** field in the Project (adds the approved amount)
- **Project Budget** if needed

Make sure they know the COR was approved so they can update these fields.

## Best Practices

✅ **Number your CORs:** Use "COR #1", "COR #2", etc. so you can reference them in conversations

✅ **Submit promptly:** Don't wait until the end of the project to ask for extra money. Submit CORs as soon as the change happens

✅ **Be specific on costs:** Break down labor, materials, equipment, and markup. Vague estimates get rejected

✅ **Document EVERYTHING:** Photos, emails, who said what when. If it goes to a dispute, you need proof

✅ **Get it in writing:** Never do extra work based on a verbal "yeah, we'll pay you." Wait for written approval or at least document the verbal agreement immediately

✅ **Track time impact:** If the change delays the schedule, document that too. You might be entitled to time extension even if cost isn't approved

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I start the extra work before the COR is approved?**  
A: **Ask your PM first.** Sometimes the GC will issue a "proceed" directive, but get it in writing. Starting work without approval is risky—you might not get paid.

**Q: What if the GC denies the COR but still wants the work done?**  
A: Escalate to your PM immediately. This is a contract dispute. Don't do work you won't be paid for.

**Q: How long does COR approval take?**  
A: Varies by GC, but typically 1-3 weeks. Budget your schedule accordingly and follow up if they're slow.

**Q: What's the difference between a COR and an RFI?**  
A: An **RFI** asks a question. A **COR** asks for more money or time. Sometimes an RFI answer leads to a COR (e.g., "Please use Method B instead of Method A" → "Method B costs $5k more, here's our COR").

**Q: Where do I see all my CORs at once?**  
A: Filter the Task Overview for "COR" in the task name. [NEEDS VERIFICATION: Exact filtering method]

**Important:** Always involve your PM or OC in COR discussions. They handle pricing and negotiation strategy. Your job is to document the facts clearly so they can fight for fair payment.
