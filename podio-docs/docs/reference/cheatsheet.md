## 🎯 The Big Picture

**PSS Workspace:** Precision Projects  
**Main Apps:** Projects → Stages → Tasks + Contacts + Safety

## 📋 Project Stages (Always in This Order)

1. **Pre-Construction** - Planning, permits, submittals, RFIs
2. **Mobilization** - Site setup, equipment, crew assignment
3. **Construction** - Active work, daily operations
4. **Demobilization** - Cleanup, punch list, equipment return

**To advance:** Change "Current Stage Status" to "[Next Stage] Active"  
**Wait 2-3 minutes** for tasks to auto-populate
