# Fields and Data Types

## What is a Field?

A field is **one piece of information** about an item. If an item is like a row in a spreadsheet, fields are the columns.

|-------|-------|-------------------|
| Job ID | Projects | Combines Job # + Job Name |
| Variance | Projects | Project Budget minus costs |
| Overall Progress | Projects | Average of stage completion % |
| Open Tasks Count | Projects | Counts incomplete linked tasks |
| Tasks Complete % | Stages | Percentage of complete tasks |
| Open Issues | Stages | Count of incomplete tasks |

## Tips for Data Entry

1. **Required fields** — Some fields must be filled before saving. Podio will tell you which ones.

2. **User fields** — Start typing a name and Podio will suggest matches from your team.

3. **Relationship fields** — These pull from another app. The item must already exist there.

4. **Multi-select categories** — You can pick more than one. Great for Scopes where a project might have Earthwork AND Utilities.

5. **Don't touch calculations** — They update automatically. You can't (and shouldn't) edit them directly.
