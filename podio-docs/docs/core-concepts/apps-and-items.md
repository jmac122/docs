# Apps and Items in Podio

## What is an App?

Think of an app like a **spreadsheet with superpowers**. Each app holds a specific type of information—projects in one app, tasks in another, contacts in a third.

But unlike a spreadsheet, Podio apps can:
- Connect to each other (link a task to its project)
- Trigger automations (create tasks automatically when something happens)
- Show different views for different needs

## What is an Item?

An item is **one entry** in an app. 

| App | Item Example |
|-----|--------------|
| Projects | "Job #2024-15 - Oak Grove Foundation" |
| Tasks | "Submit concrete mix design" |
| Contacts | "Mike Johnson at Turner Construction" |
| Stages | "Pre-Construction" |

When you create a new project, you're creating one item in the Projects app.

## PSS Workspace Apps

Your Precision Projects workspace has **7 apps**:

### Main Apps (You'll Use Daily)

| App | What It Holds | Who Uses It |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| **Projects** | Every job/project | Everyone |
| **Stages** | 5 phases per project | PMs, OCs |
| **Tasks** | Individual to-dos | Everyone |
| **Safety & Compliance** | Safety tracking (811, Badging, SSSP) | Safety team, PMs |
| **Contacts** | GC and customer info | PMs, Estimating |

### Utility Apps (Behind the Scenes)

| App | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Task Templates** | Master list of tasks—automations copy from here |
| **Subtask Templates** | Subtasks that belong to templates |

You probably won't open the template apps directly. They exist so the system can auto-create tasks for you.

## How Items Get Created

There are **three ways** items appear in Podio:

1. **You create them manually** — Click the + button, fill in fields, save
2. **Automations create them** — When you create a project, stages are auto-created
3. **Copied from templates** — Tasks are built from the Task Templates app

Most of your daily work involves items that already exist. You'll update statuses, add notes, and move things forward.

## Quick Reference: Item Counts

A typical project will have:

| App | Items Per Project |
|-----|-------------------|
| Project | 1 |
| Stages | 5 |
| Tasks | 40-60+ |
| Safety records | 1+ |
