# Linking Contacts to Projects in Podio

## Why Link Contacts to Projects?

Linking GC and customer contacts to a project gives you quick access to "who's who" on each job. When you need to send an RFI or ask a question, you'll know exactly who to reach out to.

**Benefits:**
- See all project contacts in one place
- Everyone on your team knows who the GC's PM is
- Avoid "who do I send this to?" confusion

## How to Link a Contact to a Project

### Method 1: From the Project Page

This is the easiest way if you're already looking at the project.

1. Open the **Project** in Podio
2. Find the **"Customer / GC"** field (it's a relationship field)
3. Click in the field to start typing the contact's name
4. Select the contact from the dropdown list
5. Click **Save** or just click elsewhere (Podio auto-saves relationship fields)

**Can't find the contact?**
- They might not exist in the Contacts app yet. **Add them first** (see [Adding Contacts](adding-contacts.md)), then come back and link.

**Need to link multiple contacts?**
- The **"Customer / GC"** field can hold multiple contacts. Just keep selecting and they'll all be linked.

### Method 2: From the Contact Page

Use this if you're looking at the contact and want to link them to a project.

1. Open the **Contacts** app
2. Find and open the contact you want to link
3. Find the **"Linked Projects"** field (relationship field)
4. Click in the field and start typing the project name or Job #
5. Select the project from the dropdown
6. Save

## Alternative: Use the GC Contacts Text Field

Some projects use a **"GC Contacts"** text field for quick notes about who's who. This is a free-form text area where you can type names and roles.

**When to use this:**
- Quick notes during project setup
- Contact isn't in the system yet and you just need to remember their name
- Temporary contacts who don't need a full Contact record

**Example:**
```
Sarah Johnson - GC Project Manager - 281-555-1234
Mike Davis - Safety Coordinator - 281-555-5678
```

**Note:** This is just a text note. It doesn't create a link or sync with the Contacts app. For real contacts you'll interact with often, use the relationship field instead.

## Viewing Linked Contacts

### From the Project:
1. Open the project
2. Look at the **"Customer / GC"** field
3. Click on any linked contact's name to open their full contact card (phone, email, notes, etc.)

### From the Contact:
1. Open the contact
2. Look at the **"Linked Projects"** field
3. You'll see all projects they're associated with

This works both ways—projects show their contacts, contacts show their projects.

## Best Practices

✅ **Link early:** Add contacts during project setup (Pre-Construction) so everyone knows who to talk to from day one

✅ **Keep it current:** If the GC's PM changes mid-project, unlink the old one and link the new one. Add a note in the project about the change.

✅ **Link the right people:** Focus on key decision-makers (GC PM, superintendent, safety coordinator). You don't need every person you might email.

✅ **Use both methods:** Link via the relationship field for the primary GC contact(s), and use the GC Contacts text field for quick reference notes

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I link the same contact to multiple projects?**  
A: Yes! Many GC PMs work on multiple jobs with you. Link them to every relevant project.

**Q: What if I unlink a contact by accident?**  
A: Just link them again. Unlinking doesn't delete the contact—it just removes the connection to that project.

**Q: Why are there two ways to track contacts (relationship field + text field)?**  
A: The relationship field (**Customer / GC**) creates a real database link—best for key contacts. The text field (**GC Contacts**) is for quick notes and less formal tracking. Use the relationship field when possible.

**Q: Can I link PSS employees (like our PM) to a project?**  
A: PSS team members are assigned via **User** fields (Project Manager, OC, FOCS, Foreman), not the Contacts app. Those fields are specifically for internal assignments.
