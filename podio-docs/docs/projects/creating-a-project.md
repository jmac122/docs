# Creating a New Project

When you win a new job, you need to create a project in Podio. This kicks off the whole system — stages get created automatically, tasks start flowing, and your team gets visibility.

**Time:** About 5 minutes  
**What happens:** You fill in project details → Podio creates 5 stages and a safety record automatically

---

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Open the Projects App

📸 [Screenshot placeholder: Podio workspace showing Projects app tile]

- Log into Podio
- Go to the **Precision Projects** workspace
- Click **Projects** app

---

### 2. Click "Add New Item"

📸 [Screenshot placeholder: Projects app with "Add new item" button highlighted]

- Look for the "+ Add new" button (usually top-right)
- Click it
- A blank project form will open

---

### 3. Fill in the Required Fields

These are the must-haves. Don't skip them or things will break.

![Blank project form with required fields highlighted](/img/projects/creating-editing/16-required-fields.png)

#### **Job #**
Enter a unique number for this job. 

**How to pick one:** [NEEDS VERIFICATION: Is there a numbering system? Sequential? Year-based?]

#### **Job Name**
Give it a clear, descriptive name.

**Examples:**
- "Main Street Apartments - Foundation"
- "HEB Expansion - Utilities"
- "Cypress Creek Phase 2"

**Tip:** Keep it short but specific enough that people know what job you're talking about.

#### **Division**
**THIS IS CRITICAL.** Pick the right division:
- **Concrete** (most common — foundation work, flatwork, etc.)
- **Drywall** 
- **Other**

**Why it matters:** This controls which task templates get loaded. If you pick the wrong division, you'll get the wrong tasks.

---

### 4. Fill in Team Members

Assign the people running this job:

![Team member dropdown fields](/img/projects/creating-editing/17-team-member-dropdowns.png)

- **Project Manager** (required)
- **OC - Operations Coordinator** (if applicable)
- **FOCS - Field Operations Coordinator** (if applicable)
- **Foreman** (if known — you can add later if not assigned yet)

**Tip:** If you're not sure who's assigned yet, at minimum add the PM. You can update the rest later.

---

### 5. Add Basic Job Details

Fill in what you know:

- **Company** - Select the GC or client from the dropdown (or add new)
- **Location/Address** - Where's the job site?
- **LOI/Contract Date** - When was the contract signed? (Add date range if you have start/end)
- **Scopes** - Check all that apply (Earthwork, Utilities, Foundations, etc.)

---

### 6. Add Contact Information

**Option 1: Quick Notes (GC Contacts field)**
Type names and phone numbers in the **GC Contacts** text field for quick reference.

**Option 2: Link Full Contacts (Customer / GC field)**
Click **Customer / GC** to search and select existing contacts from your Contacts app.

**Tip:** Use Option 2 if the contact already exists — it keeps info synced and you get their full email/phone/title.

---

### 7. Add Money Details

If you know the numbers, enter them now:

- **Project Budget** - How much can you spend?
- **Contract Value** - How much are you getting paid?

**Tip:** You can fill these in later if you don't have final numbers yet.

---

### 8. Upload Documents (Optional but Recommended)

If you have them, upload:
- Contract or LOI
- Site plans
- Scope of work documents

Drag and drop files into the **Documents & Logs** field.

![Documents & Logs upload area with files being dragged in](/img/projects/creating-editing/21-documents-upload.png)

---

### 9. Set Initial Stage Status

Set **Current Stage Status** to:
- **Pre-Construction Active**

This is where every project starts. Don't set it to Mobilization or Construction yet — you need to do pre-con work first.

![Current Stage Status dropdown with "Pre-Construction Active" selected](/img/projects/detail-page/12-current-stage-status.png)

---

### 10. Save the Project

Click **Save** (or **Create**, depending on your Podio version).

![Save button at bottom of form](/img/projects/creating-editing/20-save-button.png)

---

## What Happens Next (Automatically)

After you hit Save, Podio goes to work behind the scenes:

### ✅ 5 Stages Get Created
Within seconds, you'll see 5 linked stages appear:
1. Pre-Construction
2. Mobilization
3. Construction
4. Demobilization
5. Retainage

![Linked Stages field showing all 5 stages created](/img/projects/detail-page/13-linked-stages.png)

### ✅ Safety Record Gets Created
A blank Safety & Compliance record gets created and linked to your project.

### ✅ Pre-Construction Tasks Get Created
Because you set the stage to "Pre-Construction Active", tasks for that stage start populating.

**Wait 2-3 minutes.** Then refresh the project page.

### ✅ You'll Get a Notification
[NEEDS VERIFICATION: Does Podio notify the PM or creator when stages/tasks are created?]

---

## Check Your Work

Go back to the project page and make sure:

1. **Linked Stages** shows all 5 stages
2. Click the **Pre-Construction** stage → you should see tasks populating
3. **Open Tasks Count** is climbing (tasks are being created)
4. Team members are assigned correctly
5. Division is correct (this can't easily be changed later without recreating tasks)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Wrong Division Selected
**Problem:** You picked "Drywall" but this is a concrete job.  
**Fix:** Change the Division field BEFORE tasks finish creating. If tasks already exist, you may need to delete the project and start over. [NEEDS VERIFICATION: Can you change division mid-project?]

### ❌ Forgot to Set Stage to Pre-Construction Active
**Problem:** You left Current Stage Status blank.  
**Fix:** Edit the project and set it to "Pre-Construction Active". Tasks should start creating.

### ❌ Duplicate Job #
**Problem:** You used a Job # that already exists.  
**Fix:** Pick a new unique number. [NEEDS VERIFICATION: Does Podio block duplicate Job #s?]

### ❌ No PM Assigned
**Problem:** Project has no owner.  
**Fix:** Edit and add a Project Manager immediately.

## What's Next?

Now that your project exists:

1. **Review Pre-Construction tasks** - Click into the Pre-Construction stage and start working through tasks
2. **Add any missing info** - Update budget, contacts, documents as you get them
3. **Assign tasks** - Make sure each task has a responsible person
4. **Start working** - Pre-Construction is 75% of project success. Don't rush it.
