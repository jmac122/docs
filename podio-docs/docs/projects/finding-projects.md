# Finding Projects

You've got dozens (or hundreds) of projects in Podio. Here's how to find the one you need fast.

---

## Method 1: Browse the Projects List

### Open the Projects App

![Podio workspace with Projects app highlighted](/img/getting-started/01-workspace-home.png)

- Go to **Precision Projects** workspace
- Click **Projects**
- You'll see a list of all projects

![Projects list view showing multiple projects](/img/projects/list-views/01-projects-list-all.png)

---

### Sort the List

Click the column headers to sort:

- **Job ID** - Sort alphabetically by job number and name
- **Date Entered** - Find newest or oldest projects
- **Current Stage Status** - Group by stage (all Pre-Con projects together, etc.)
- **Project Manager** - See all projects by PM

![Projects list with column headers highlighted for sorting](/img/projects/list-views/05-column-headers-sortable.png)

**Tip:** Click the header once to sort ascending (A-Z, oldest-newest), click again to sort descending (Z-A, newest-oldest).

---

## Method 2: Search by Job # or Name

### Use the Search Box

:::note Screenshot needed
Podio global search box at top of screen
:::

At the top of Podio, there's a search box.

1. Type the **Job #** or **Job Name** (or part of it)
2. Hit Enter
3. Projects matching your search will appear

**Examples:**
- Search "12345" → finds Job #12345
- Search "Main Street" → finds "Main Street Apartments"
- Search "HEB" → finds all HEB-related jobs

**Tip:** You don't need to type the whole name. A few characters usually work.

## Method 3: Filter by Stage

Want to see only active construction projects? Or all jobs in Pre-Con?

### Use the Filter Sidebar

![Projects app with filter sidebar visible](/img/projects/list-views/02-filter-sidebar-stages.png)

1. In the Projects app, look for **Filters** on the left side
2. Click **Current Stage Status**
3. Check the stages you want to see:
   - Pre-Construction Active
   - Mobilization Active
   - Construction Active
   - Demobilization Active
   - Retainage Active
4. The list updates to show only those projects

![Filter sidebar with stage checkboxes and results filtered](/img/projects/list-views/02-filter-sidebar-stages.png)

**Tip:** You can select multiple stages to see, for example, all jobs in Construction OR Demob.

---

## Method 4: Filter by Team Member

Need to see all jobs assigned to a specific PM or foreman?

### Filter by User

![Filter sidebar showing user fields](/img/projects/list-views/02-filter-sidebar-stages.png)

1. In the Projects app, click **Filters**
2. Click **Project Manager**, **Foreman**, **OC**, or **FOCS**
3. Select the person's name
4. List shows only projects assigned to that person

**Use case:** A PM wants to see only their projects. Filter by their name under Project Manager.

---

## Method 5: Filter by Division

Working only on Concrete jobs? Or Drywall?

### Filter by Division

1. In **Filters**, click **Division**
2. Select **Concrete**, **Drywall**, or **Other**
3. List shows only projects in that division

:::note Screenshot needed

## Method 6: Filter by Company/GC

Want to see all jobs for a specific general contractor?

### Filter by Company

1. In **Filters**, click **Company**
2. Select the GC name from the list
3. List shows only projects for that company

## Method 7: Combine Filters

You can stack filters to narrow results:

**Example:**
- Filter by **Division = Concrete**
- AND **Project Manager = John Smith**
- AND **Current Stage Status = Construction Active**

Result: Only active construction concrete jobs managed by John.

:::note Screenshot needed

**Tip:** Clear filters by clicking the X next to each one, or click "Clear all filters" at the top.

## Method 8: Save a Custom View

If you use the same filters repeatedly, save them as a view.

[NEEDS VERIFICATION: Does Podio allow saving custom views? If so, document the steps here.]

---

## Method 9: Use Recent Projects

Podio remembers what you've recently viewed.

Look for a **Recent** or **History** section [NEEDS VERIFICATION: Where does Podio show recently accessed items?]

Click a recently viewed project to jump back to it.

## Tips for Faster Searching

### Keep Job Names Consistent
Use a consistent naming format:
- "Client Name - Scope" (e.g., "HEB Expansion - Utilities")
- Makes searching easier

### Use Job # for Precision
If you know the exact Job #, search by that — it's faster than scrolling.

### Filter by Stage for Daily Work
Most people filter by stage daily:
- PMs: Filter for "Pre-Construction Active" in the morning to review new jobs
- Foremen: Filter for "Construction Active" to see active job sites
- Admins: Filter for "Retainage Active" to handle closeout

### Bookmark Frequently Used Filters

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find my project!"

**Check:**
1. Are filters applied that might be hiding it? Clear all filters and try again.
2. Did you search the exact Job # or Name? Try searching just part of the name.
3. Was the project actually created? Check with whoever was supposed to create it.
4. Do you have permission to see it? [NEEDS VERIFICATION: Are there project-level permissions in Podio?]

### "The list is too long to scroll through"

Use filters! Don't try to scroll through hundreds of projects. Filter by stage, division, or PM to narrow it down.

### "I need to find archived projects"

[NEEDS VERIFICATION: How are completed projects handled? Are they archived? Deleted? Marked with a specific status?]
