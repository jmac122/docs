# Finding Your Tasks in Podio

## Where Your Tasks Live

Your tasks in Podio are always connected to a **Project** and a **Stage**. Think of it like:
- **Project** = The job site
- **Stage** = What phase the job is in (Pre-Construction, Mobilization, Construction, etc.)
- **Task** = Your specific to-do item

## Quick Access: My Tasks View

The fastest way to see everything assigned to you:

1. Click the **Tasks** app from your Podio workspace
2. Use the filter to show tasks where **Responsible** = You
3. Sort by **Due Date** to see what's urgent

**What you'll see:**
- Task Name
- Status (Pending/red, In Progress/yellow, Complete/green)
- Due Date
- Which Project and Stage it belongs to

## Finding Tasks by Project

If you want to see all tasks for a specific job:

1. Open the **Projects** app
2. Find and click your project
3. Click into the **Current Stage Status** to see which stage is active
4. Look at the **Linked Stages** section
5. Click the active stage (e.g., "Pre-Construction Active")
6. Scroll to **Task Overview** to see all tasks for that stage

**Why this matters:** Tasks are organized by stage because different work happens at different phases. Pre-Construction tasks are about planning and permits. Construction tasks are about daily field work.

## Understanding Task Status Colors

- 🔴 **Pending (Red)** - Not started yet, might be waiting on something
- 🟡 **In Progress (Yellow)** - Actively being worked on
- 🟢 **Complete (Green)** - Done!

## Task Count on Your Project

On each Project page, you'll see **Open Tasks Count**. This is the total number of incomplete tasks across all stages.

If this number is high, it means there's lots to do. If it's zero, you're either done or tasks haven't been created yet for the active stage.

## Dependent vs Independent Tasks

Some tasks show **"Ind or Dep"** as either:
- **Independent** - You can start this right away
- **Dependent** - This task is waiting for another task to finish first

**If a task is Dependent and shows Pending status**, check the **Dependencies** field to see what needs to be completed before you can start.

More on this in [dependencies.md](dependencies.md).

## Tips

- **Check your tasks daily** - New tasks get added automatically when a stage goes active
- **Filter by Status = Pending** to see what needs attention
- **Sort by Due Date** to stay on top of deadlines
- **Click into a task** to see notes, attachments, and who else is involved
