# How to Mark Tasks Complete

## The Simple Version

1. Open the task (click it from the Tasks app or from a Stage's Task Overview)
2. Change **Status** from "In Progress" or "Pending" to **"Complete"**
3. Click **Save**

That's it! ✅

## Why Completing Tasks Matters

When you mark a task complete, two important things happen:

### 1. Progress Tracking Updates
- The **Tasks Complete %** on your Stage goes up
- The **Overall Progress** on your Project updates
- The **Open Tasks Count** goes down

This helps everyone see how the job is moving forward.

### 2. Dependent Tasks Unlock (Automatic!)
If other tasks were waiting on yours to finish, **they automatically change from Pending to In Progress** and the responsible person gets notified.

**Example:**
- You complete "Submit SSSP to Safety Director"
- Automatically: "Receive SSSP Approval" changes to In Progress
- Automatically: The person assigned to that task gets a notification

This keeps the workflow moving without anyone having to manually update chains of tasks.

## Before You Mark Complete: Checklist

✅ **Is the work actually done?**
- Don't mark complete if it's "almost done" or "waiting on feedback"
- If waiting, leave it In Progress and add a note in the **Notes** field

✅ **Did you add any important info?**
- Upload files to **Attachments** if needed (photos, signed forms, etc.)
- Add notes in the **Notes** field about what was done or any issues

✅ **Are there dependencies?**
- If this task is blocking others, completing it will unlock them
- Check the task to see if anything depends on it (you'll see references in the Dependencies field on other tasks)

## What If I Completed It By Mistake?

No problem! Just:
1. Re-open the task
2. Change **Status** back to "In Progress" or "Pending"
3. Save

If it was a dependent task that unlocked others, those will stay In Progress (they won't revert automatically). You might need to communicate with those people.

## Recurring Tasks

Some tasks have **Type = Recurring**. These are things that happen regularly, like:
- Weekly safety meetings
- Daily field reports
- Weekly equipment checks

When you complete a recurring task:
- The completed task stays in the system (record keeping)
- A new copy automatically gets created for next time (usually weekly)
- You'll see it pop back up in your task list

**Don't delete recurring tasks** - just complete them and a fresh one will appear.

## Tips for Staying Organized

- **Complete tasks as soon as they're done** - Don't wait until end of day
- **Use the Notes field** - Future you (or your PM) will appreciate the context
- **Attach proof** - Photos, signed docs, email confirmations make life easier later
- **Check dependencies** - If you're blocked, leave it Pending and note why in Notes field
