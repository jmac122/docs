# Adding GC and Customer Contacts to Podio

## Why Add Contacts?

The **Contacts** app stores information about General Contractors (GCs), subcontractors, suppliers, and customer contacts. Having their info in Podio means:
- Quick access to phone numbers and emails
- You can link them to projects they're involved in
- Everyone on your team can see who's who

## Tips for Good Contact Management

✅ **Use full names:** "Sarah Johnson" not "Sarah" (you might work with multiple Sarahs)

✅ **Add job titles:** Helps you remember who does what ("GC Project Manager" vs. "Safety Coordinator")

✅ **Keep notes updated:** If they change roles, prefer certain communication methods, or have quirks, write it down

✅ **Pick the right Organization:** This groups contacts by company, making it easier to find "everyone from ABC Construction"

## Common Questions

**Q: What if the person works for multiple companies?**  
A: Pick their primary company for **Organization**. Mention the other companies in the **Notes** field.

**Q: Can I add internal PSS employees as contacts?**  
A: You *can*, but it's usually not necessary. Internal people are assigned via the **User** fields (PM, OC, FOCS, Foreman) on projects. The Contacts app is mainly for external people.

**Q: What if I don't have all their info yet?**  
A: Add what you know. You can edit the contact later to fill in missing details.

**Q: How do I find a contact later?**  
A: In the Contacts app, use the search bar at the top. Search by name, company, or even phone number.

## What's Next?

After adding a contact, you'll probably want to **link them to a project** so you can quickly see who's involved in each job.
