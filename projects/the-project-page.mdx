## Progress & Status Fields

### Current Stage Status
**What it is:** Where the project is right now (dropdown: Pre-Construction Active, Mobilization Active, Construction Active, Demobilization Active, Retainage Active).

**Why it matters:** **This is THE most important field.** Changing this field triggers automation to create tasks for the next stage.

**How it works:**
- Set to "Pre-Construction Active" when project starts
- Change to "Mobilization Active" when ready to mobilize → tasks auto-create
- Change to "Construction Active" when ready to start work → tasks auto-create
- And so on through Demob and Retainage

**Why it matters:** **This controls which tasks get created!** Different divisions have different task templates. Make sure you pick the right one when creating a project.

## Tips

1. **Fill out Division first** when creating a project — it determines which tasks you'll get.
2. **Don't mess with Current Stage Status** unless you're actually ready to advance. It triggers big automations.
3. **Use Customer / GC for important contacts** instead of GC Contacts — it's more powerful and keeps info synced.
4. **Upload documents early** — contracts, plans, LOIs. Future-you will thank you.
5. **Check Variance regularly** — if it's going negative, dig into costs.
