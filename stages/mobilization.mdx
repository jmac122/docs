# Mobilization Stage

**Getting the job site ready to work.**

Mobilization (Mob) is the bridge between planning (Pre-Construction) and doing (Construction). This is when you physically set up the site, deliver equipment, assign the crew, and make sure everything is ready to start actual work.

---

## What Is Mobilization?

Mobilization is the setup phase. You're taking all the planning from Pre-Con and making it real on the ground.

**You're doing:**
- Setting up the job site (trailers, fencing, utilities)
- Delivering equipment and tools
- Assigning and briefing the crew
- Final safety checks
- Staging materials
- Confirming access and logistics

**You're NOT doing:**
- Actual construction work (that's next stage)
- Pouring concrete, setting rebar, etc.

Think of Mobilization like setting up a temporary base camp. Once it's set up, you're ready to execute.

---

## When Does Mobilization Start?

**Mobilization starts when you advance from Pre-Construction.**

When Pre-Con is done (or close to done), you change **Current Stage Status** to **"Mobilization Active"**.

Within 2-3 minutes, Podio creates tasks for Mobilization.

## How Many Tasks in Mobilization?

[NEEDS VERIFICATION: How many tasks are in Mobilization for Concrete division? Drywall division?]

Mobilization typically has fewer tasks than Pre-Con because it's more straightforward — it's mostly execution (set up X, deliver Y, brief Z).

## Major Categories of Mobilization Work

### 1. Site Setup
Get the physical job site ready.

**Tasks may include:**
- Install temporary fencing (if required)
- Set up job trailers or office space (if applicable)
- Set up temporary utilities (power, water, sanitation)
- Mark boundaries and work zones
- Set up safety barriers and signage
- Establish material staging areas

**Why it matters:** A well-organized site is safer and more efficient.

### 2. Equipment Delivery
Get the tools and machines on-site.

**Tasks may include:**
- Deliver concrete trucks (if needed for this job)
- Deliver excavators, backhoes, etc. (if applicable)
- Deliver hand tools and small equipment
- Inspect equipment condition upon delivery
- Ensure equipment is fueled and ready

**Why it matters:** Can't work without tools. Get them on-site early so you're not waiting on delivery day-of.

---

### 3. Crew Assignment & Briefing
Make sure the right people are assigned and they know the plan.

**Tasks may include:**
- Assign crew members to the job
- Conduct pre-job crew briefing (scope, schedule, safety, logistics)
- Distribute site access info (gate codes, parking, contact numbers)
- Review drawings and plans with foreman and crew
- Confirm crew understands roles and responsibilities

**Why it matters:** The crew can't execute what they don't understand. Brief them thoroughly.

---

### 4. Final Safety Checks
Before work starts, double-check safety.

**Tasks may include:**
- Verify SSSP is on-site and crew has reviewed it
- Conduct toolbox talk / safety meeting
- Inspect PPE (hard hats, vests, boots, gloves, etc.)
- Verify first aid kit is on-site
- Confirm emergency contacts are posted
- Review site-specific hazards with crew

**Why it matters:** Last chance to catch safety issues before work begins.

---

### 5. Material Staging
Get materials delivered and organized.

**Tasks may include:**
- Coordinate material delivery (rebar, concrete, forms, etc.)
- Verify delivery quantities against order
- Stage materials in designated areas (keep pathways clear)
- Protect materials from weather/damage
- Confirm materials match approved submittals

**Why it matters:** Having materials on-site (and in the right spot) prevents delays on day 1 of construction.

---

### 6. Access & Logistics Confirmation
Make sure everyone can get to the site and knows where to go.

**Tasks may include:**
- Confirm site access (gates, roads, parking)
- Distribute gate codes or access badges
- Identify parking areas for crew and equipment
- Confirm delivery routes for trucks
- Notify neighbors or adjacent properties (if required)
- Confirm work hours and noise restrictions

**Why it matters:** Don't show up Day 1 and realize the gate code doesn't work or parking is blocked.

---

### 7. Final Coordination with GC
Last-minute alignment with the general contractor.

**Tasks may include:**
- Confirm start date with GC
- Verify site is ready for your work (previous trades finished?)
- Get any final approvals or sign-offs
- Confirm daily check-in process
- Exchange contact info for on-site coordination

**Why it matters:** GC needs to know when you're starting. Make sure they're ready for you.

---

## Task Dependencies in Mobilization

Some Mobilization tasks depend on Pre-Con tasks being done first.

**Example:**
- Can't deliver equipment until site access is confirmed (Pre-Con task)
- Can't brief crew until submittals are approved and you know the final plan (Pre-Con task)

Podio tracks these dependencies automatically.

## Mobilization Timeline

**How long does Mobilization take?**

**Typical duration: 1-3 days**

**Factors that speed it up:**
- Small job site (just park and unload)
- Minimal equipment needed
- Small crew
- No site setup required (existing infrastructure)

**Factors that slow it down:**
- Large job site requiring extensive setup (fencing, trailers, utilities)
- Complex logistics (restricted access, narrow roads, coordination with other trades)
- Weather delays (can't set up in heavy rain/snow)
- Equipment delivery delays

**Most jobs:** Mobilization happens quickly once Pre-Con is done. It's mostly physical execution, not waiting on approvals.

## How to Know When Mobilization Is Done

Mobilization is "done" when:

✅ Site is physically set up (fencing, trailers, barriers, signage in place)  
✅ Equipment is on-site and operational  
✅ Crew is assigned and briefed  
✅ Materials are staged and ready  
✅ Safety checks are complete  
✅ Access and logistics are confirmed  
✅ GC is notified and aligned  
✅ You're ready to start actual construction work tomorrow  

**Check your tasks:** If all Mobilization tasks are Complete (or nearly complete), you're ready to advance to Construction.

## Common Mobilization Mistakes

### ❌ Starting Construction Before Mobilization Is Done
**Problem:** Crew shows up Day 1 and equipment isn't there, or materials aren't staged, or safety checks weren't done.  
**Result:** Wasted day, frustrated crew, potential safety issues.

**Fix:** Don't advance to Construction until Mobilization is actually complete.

---

### ❌ No Crew Briefing
**Problem:** Crew shows up and nobody explained the plan.  
**Result:** Confusion, mistakes, rework.

**Fix:** Always brief the crew before work starts. 30-minute briefing saves hours of confusion.

---

### ❌ Forgetting Access Details
**Problem:** Crew arrives at the gate and doesn't have the code, or parking is full and nobody told them where to park.  
**Result:** Delayed start, frustrated crew.

**Fix:** Distribute access info (gate codes, parking, contacts) BEFORE Day 1.

---

### ❌ Equipment Not Ready
**Problem:** Equipment is delivered but not fueled, or it's broken and nobody checked.  
**Result:** Can't start work.

**Fix:** Inspect equipment upon delivery. Make sure it's ready to go.

---

### ❌ Materials Delivered to Wrong Location
**Problem:** Rebar shows up but it's blocking the entrance, or it's in the rain and rusting.  
**Result:** Wasted time moving materials, or damaged materials.

**Fix:** Plan material staging areas ahead of time. Mark them on a site plan and share with delivery drivers.

## Tips for Smooth Mobilization

### 1. Do a Site Walk
Before Mobilization starts, the foreman and PM should walk the site together.

**Check:**
- Where will equipment go?
- Where will materials be staged?
- Where's the crew parking?
- Are there any surprises (muddy areas, obstructions, etc.)?

---

### 2. Create a Mobilization Checklist
[NEEDS VERIFICATION: Does Podio auto-create a Mobilization checklist, or do you make one manually?]

**Checklist might include:**
- [ ] Fencing installed
- [ ] Equipment delivered
- [ ] Crew briefed
- [ ] Materials staged
- [ ] Safety meeting held
- [ ] Access confirmed
- [ ] GC notified

Check items off as you go.

---

### 3. Communicate with the Crew
Send a message or hold a quick meeting:

> "We're mobilizing Tuesday. Here's the plan:  
> - Meet at the shop at 7 AM  
> - Drive to site together (123 Main St)  
> - Gate code is 4567  
> - Park in the south lot  
> - We'll do a safety briefing on-site at 7:30  
> - Then we start setting up equipment  
> - Questions?"

Clear communication = smooth start.

---

### 4. Verify Equipment Before Delivery
Don't assume the equipment rental company sent the right stuff.

**Check:**
- Is it the right equipment?
- Is it in good condition?
- Is it fueled?
- Are attachments included?

If something's wrong, deal with it now — not when the crew needs it.

---

### 5. Have a Backup Plan
**What if:**
- Equipment delivery is delayed? (Can you start with hand tools?)
- Weather is bad? (Can you do site setup another day?)
- Materials don't show up? (Can you work on something else?)

Don't let one hiccup derail the whole Mobilization.

---

### 6. Don't Rush
Mobilization is usually quick (1-3 days), but don't skip steps.

**Example:**  
Don't skip the crew briefing to save 30 minutes. That 30 minutes prevents hours of confusion later.
