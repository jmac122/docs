# Managing Submittals in Podio

## What Are Submittals?

Submittals are documents you send to the General Contractor (GC) for approval before starting work. Think of them as "here's what we plan to do—can you approve it?" Examples include:
- Material specifications
- Product data sheets
- Shop drawings
- Installation procedures

Getting submittals approved is a **critical Pre-Construction task**. You can't start work until the GC signs off.

## Where Submittals Live

Submittals are tracked as **Tasks** in the **Pre-Construction Stage** of your project.

## How to Track a Submittal

### 1. Find the Submittal Task

1. Open your **Project** in Podio
2. Click on the **Pre-Construction** stage from the "Linked Stages" field
3. Look in the **Task Overview** section for tasks related to submittals
   - Example task names might include "Submittal: [Material/Product Name]" or "Submit Product Data"

### 2. Update the Task as You Work

**When you create the submittal:**
1. Open the task
2. Change **Status** to "In Progress" (yellow)
3. Upload your submittal document to the **Attachments** field
4. Add any notes in the **Notes** field (e.g., "Sent to GC via email on 3/15")

**When the GC approves:**
1. Change **Status** to "Complete" (green)
2. Upload the approved version to **Attachments**
3. Add a note: "Approved by [Name] on [Date]"

**If revisions are needed:**
1. Keep **Status** as "In Progress"
2. Add a note explaining what needs to change
3. Upload the revised version when ready

### 3. Track Dependencies

Some submittals must be approved before other tasks can start. The system handles this automatically:
- When you mark a submittal task **Complete**, any dependent tasks will automatically change from "Pending" to "In Progress"
- The person responsible for the next task gets notified

**Example:** You can't order materials until the material submittal is approved. The "Order Materials" task depends on "Submittal: Material Specs" being complete.

## Best Practices

✅ **Upload everything:** Keep all versions (draft, revised, approved) in the task Attachments. It creates a complete record.

✅ **Use Notes generously:** Record who you sent it to, when, and what they said. Future-you will thank you.

✅ **Check Due Dates:** Pre-Construction tasks often have tight deadlines. Missing a submittal deadline can delay the entire project.

✅ **Tag the right person:** Make sure the **Responsible** field shows who's handling the submittal (usually the PM or OC).

## Common Questions

**Q: Where do I see all submittals at once?**  
A: Open the Pre-Construction stage and filter the Task Overview by searching for "submittal" in the task names. [NEEDS VERIFICATION: Exact filter method]

**Q: What if the GC loses our submittal?**  
A: Check the task Attachments. You have a copy there. Re-send it and add a note documenting the re-submission.

**Q: Can I add my own submittal tasks?**  
A: Yes! In the Pre-Construction stage's Task Overview, click "Add Task" and create a new one. Set the **Type** to "Task" and link it to the stage.
