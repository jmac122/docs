# How to Assign and Reassign Tasks

## Who Can Assign Tasks?

**Anyone can reassign a task**, but typically:
- **Project Managers** assign most tasks during planning
- **Foremen** might reassign field tasks to specific crew members
- **Operations Coordinators** reassign tasks when workload shifts

**Best practice:** If you're reassigning someone else's task, communicate with them first. Don't just pull tasks away without explanation.

## How to Assign a Task to Someone

### When Creating a New Task
If you're creating a task manually (see [creating-tasks.md](creating-tasks.md)):

1. Fill out the task details
2. In the **Responsible** field, click the dropdown
3. Select the person from the list of PSS team members
4. Save the task

That person will get a notification that they've been assigned a new task.

### When Reassigning an Existing Task

1. Open the task (from Tasks app or from a Stage's Task Overview)
2. Click **Edit** (or the Responsible field might be directly editable)
3. Click the **Responsible** field
4. Select the new person from the dropdown
5. **Optional but recommended:** Add a note in the **Notes** field explaining why you reassigned it
6. Click **Save**

**What happens:**
- The **new** person gets a notification they've been assigned the task
- The **old** person gets a notification they've been unassigned (or it disappears from their task list)
- The task now shows up in the new person's filtered task view

## Reassigning Multiple Tasks at Once

[NEEDS VERIFICATION: Can you bulk-reassign tasks in Podio, or is it one at a time?]

If you need to reassign many tasks (e.g., Foreman is out sick, need to shift 10 tasks to someone else):

**Option 1: One at a time** (confirmed to work)
- Open each task, change Responsible field, save
- Time-consuming but reliable

**Option 2: Bulk edit** [NEEDS VERIFICATION]
- Some Podio views allow multi-select and bulk edit
- Check if your Tasks app has this feature
- If so: Select multiple tasks → Edit → Change Responsible → Save all

**Talk to your PM or OC** if you need to do bulk reassignments - they might have faster workflows.

## When to Reassign Tasks

### Workload Balancing
If someone has too many tasks and another person has capacity:
- Look at Open Tasks Count per person
- Reassign lower-priority or less urgent tasks to balance

### Skill Matching
If a task requires specific expertise:
- Reassign "Review structural drawings" to someone with engineering background
- Reassign "Coordinate concrete pour" to experienced foreman

### Availability Changes
- Someone goes on vacation → reassign their tasks before they leave
- New hire joins → start assigning them tasks
- Someone is out sick → temporarily reassign urgent tasks

### Task Dependencies Clarification
Sometimes a task is assigned to the wrong person in the workflow:
- "Receive permit approval" should go to PM who submitted it, not the person who prepared docs
- Reassign to match who actually does that step

## Best Practices for Assigning Tasks

✅ **Do:**
- **Communicate the reassignment** - send a message, don't just silently move tasks
- **Check availability** - don't assign to someone who's out of office
- **Consider dependencies** - if Task B depends on Task A, assign them to people who coordinate well
- **Add notes** - explain context when assigning complex tasks
- **Set realistic due dates** - don't assign 10 tasks due tomorrow to one person

❌ **Don't:**
- Assign tasks to "TBD" or leave blank - every task needs an owner
- Reassign repeatedly - pick the right person and stick with it
- Assign tasks to someone without checking with them first on complex work
- Hoard tasks - if you're overloaded, ask for help and redistribute

## Assigning to Roles vs People

Most tasks are assigned to **specific people** (e.g., "Jared McKenzie").

Some tasks in templates might reference **roles** (e.g., "Project Manager" or "Foreman"):
- When these tasks are created from templates, the automation tries to fill in the actual person based on the Project's PM/Foreman/OC/FOCS fields
- If it's blank, you'll need to manually assign

**If you see a task assigned to a role instead of a person:**
1. Open the task
2. Change **Responsible** from the role to the actual person's name
3. Save

## Checking Who Has What

### View Your Own Tasks
1. Go to **Tasks** app
2. Filter **Responsible = You**
3. Sort by **Status** or **Due Date**

### View Someone Else's Tasks
1. Go to **Tasks** app
2. Filter **Responsible = [Their Name]**
3. See what they have on their plate

### View All Tasks for a Stage
1. Open the **Project**
2. Click into the **Stage**
3. Look at **Task Overview**
4. You'll see all tasks with who's responsible for each

This helps PMs see workload distribution and identify bottlenecks.

## Notifications

When you assign or reassign a task:
- The newly assigned person gets a **Podio notification** (bell icon or email, depending on their settings)
- They'll see: Task name, Project, Due Date, and that it was assigned to them

**Make sure your team checks Podio notifications regularly** - otherwise they might miss new assignments.

## What If No One is Available?

If you're trying to assign a task but everyone is swamped:

1. **Extend the due date** if possible - give whoever you assign more time
2. **Talk to your PM or OC** - they might have solutions (bring in subcontractor, reprioritize other work)
3. **Mark it Pending** - keep it in Pending status until someone has capacity, then reassign and move to In Progress

Don't let tasks sit unassigned - every task needs an owner, even if the owner is "waiting for capacity."

## Tips

- **Check task dependencies before reassigning** - if Task B depends on Task A, make sure the two people coordinate
- **Reassign proactively** - if you know you can't complete a task, reassign it ASAP, don't wait until it's late
- **Use the Notes field** - when you reassign, add a note: "Reassigned to Jake - has electrical experience needed for this task"
- **Track recurring tasks** - if a recurring task is always assigned to the same person, that's probably intentional (e.g., Foreman always does daily reports)
