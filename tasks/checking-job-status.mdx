# How to Check Task Progress on a Project

## Quick Project Health Check

Want to see how a job is progressing? Here's what to look at:

### 1. Open the Project
Go to **Projects** app → Click the job you want to check

### 2. Key Numbers to Check

**Overall Progress**
- Shows average completion % across all stages
- If it's 75%, the job is 75% done overall
- This is calculated automatically based on stage completion

**Open Tasks Count**
- How many incomplete tasks are left
- High number = lots of work remaining
- Zero = either done or no tasks created yet for active stage

**Current Stage Status**
- Shows which phase is active (e.g., "Construction Active")
- Only one stage can be active at a time

### 3. Dive Into Stage Details

Scroll down to **Linked Stages** section. You'll see all 5 stages:
1. Pre-Construction
2. Mobilization
3. Construction
4. Demobilization
5. Retainage

Click into a stage to see:
- **Tasks Complete %** - how much of that stage is done
- **Open Issues** - count of incomplete tasks in that stage
- **Task Overview** - list of all tasks for that stage

## Understanding Stage Progress

Each stage has its own **Tasks Complete %**:
- **0%** = Haven't started (or tasks not created yet)
- **50%** = Halfway through the stage
- **100%** = Stage complete, ready to move to next

**Important:** Tasks don't appear for a stage until that stage becomes active. So if you're in Pre-Construction, you won't see Construction tasks yet. They get created automatically when you advance to that stage (see [task-population.md](../automations/task-population.md)).

## Task Status Breakdown

Within each stage, tasks will be color-coded:

- 🔴 **Pending (Red)** - Not started, might be waiting on dependencies
- 🟡 **In Progress (Yellow)** - Being worked on now
- 🟢 **Complete (Green)** - Done!

**To see the breakdown:**
1. Click into the Stage
2. Look at **Task Overview**
3. Sort or filter by **Status**

## Checking Individual Task Details

Click any task to see:
- **Responsible** - who's assigned
- **Due Date** - when it's due
- **Status** - current state
- **Dependencies** - what it's waiting on or blocking
- **Notes** - context and updates
- **Attachments** - files, photos, documents

This is helpful if you see a task stuck in Pending and want to know why.

## For Project Managers: Daily Checklist

1. **Check Open Tasks Count** - is it growing or shrinking?
2. **Review Current Stage's Tasks Complete %** - are we on track?
3. **Filter tasks by Status = Pending** - are any stuck waiting too long?
4. **Check Dependencies** - are chains moving or blocked?
5. **Review upcoming Due Dates** - anything about to be late?

## For Field Crew: What You Need to Know

**"What am I supposed to be working on today?"**
1. Open **Tasks** app
2. Filter **Responsible = You** + **Status = In Progress**
3. Sort by **Due Date**
4. Start at the top

**"Is my task ready to start?"**
- If **Status = Pending** and **Ind or Dep = Dependent**, check the **Dependencies** field
- If it lists another task, that task needs to be completed first
- If **Ind or Dep = Independent**, you can start right away

## Tips

- **Tasks Complete %** updates automatically as tasks are completed
- If a stage shows 0% progress but should have tasks, wait 2-3 minutes after activating the stage (see [task-population.md](../automations/task-population.md))
- **Overall Progress** is an average of all stages, not just the current one
- Completed stages still show in the Linked Stages list with 100% progress
